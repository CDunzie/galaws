<notediv><title><b>PREFACE.</b><br set="CENTER" /></title><note><p>THE [Illegible Text] mode of compiling the Laws with various notes, is under the [Illegible Text] Section of a Law of 1852, which is in these words:</p><p>SEC. III. <i>And be it further enacted, c.,</i> That it shall be the duty of his Excellency the Governor to procure some fit and proper person, to prepare the several Acts for publication, whose duty it shall be to distinguish the [Illegible Text] Laws from those that are private and local; to arrange the Public [Illegible Text] under appropriate titles; to prepare for publication, side notes and head [Illegible Text], for convenience of reference; to add notes referring back to such [Illegible Text] legislarion as may be modified or repealed; and notes giving the [Illegible Text] of the Supreme Court upon that subject matter, since the last publication of the Laws, together with a copious Index. [Acts of 1851-[Illegible Text], p. 253.]</p><p>The short time allowed for the compilation and notes, has prevented me from [Illegible Text] the notes as full and perfect as I might have done. I trust, however, that they will in some good degree subserve the end proposed, and preve useful.</p><p><list><item><p>1st I felt that all Laws of general interest ought to occupy separate and [Illegible Text] ground, and not be buried under the numerous Rail Road and other Charters, many of which are either quite local or will never be put into operation. [Illegible Text] I have embraced under Public Laws, none but what are strictly public, with a few partial and necessary exceptions. I therefore exclude an put under Private Laws, Rail Road and Bank Charters, Joint Stock Companies, c., retaining all Laws relating to the State Road, and the Central Bank; and also, an Act as to the creditors of the Darien Bank, for a reason in my note to the Act.</p></item><item><p>2d. As to the Judiciary, my principle being that all Laws relating directly to the pursuit of remedies before the Courts, (except Justices' Courts,) belong properly to the Judiciary; I have carried forward Attachments, c., and brought back Rent Laws and others within and under this head.

<page id="GA1853.1.P4" no="GA1853.1.iv" />

And then as to those titles appropriately within the Judiciary, I have arranged them alphabetically.</p><p>I leave the title, Ex'rs, Adm'rs, Ordin'y, c., where [Illegible Text] put it, (which order Mr. Cobb adopted,) for several reasons, especially as my principle of arrangement did not require a change. It is therefore put outside of the Judiciary, but under Public Laws.</p></item><item><p>3d. <i>Notes referring to prior legislation.</i>In my view of this requirement, it was impossible to execute it properly, without more time than was consistent with the public anxiety to get the published Laws. But this branch has consumed most of my time. Besides aiming to point to the title where the subject is found in the old Law, and in most cases to the page and section, I have in nearly every instance of sufficient interest, attempted to <i>tell what the old law was,</i> and to point out the particular part, modified or repealed.</p></item><item><p>4th. As to the Supreme Court decisions, I have attempted to comply with the Law, as fully as possible under the circumstances stated.</p></item></list></p><p>Respectfully submitted.</p><pre>JOHN RUTHERFORD,<br set="RIGHT"><i>Compiler.</i><br set="RIGHT" /></br></pre></note></notediv>

<notediv><title>EXPLANATORY NOTE.<br set="CENTER" /></title><note><p>BILLS as they finally pass into Laws, are known as the engrossed Acts. They are always enrolled, i. e. copied in a large, plain hand; and the latter, alone, are signed by the Governor and the other officers; and hence the enrolled Acts are the Laws. The original drafts, or the engrossed copies, are turned over to the Compiler and Printer. I have been careful to note any variation between them as follows:</p><p><list><item><p>1st. [that] Where a word or expression differs, I insert the word or expression of the engrossed copy, in a bracket, thus: [that.]</p></item><item><p>2d. [] If the enrolled has a word, c., and nothing corresponds in the engrossed, I show it by a blank bracket, thus: []</p></item><item><p>3d. [that] If the engrossed Act has a word, c., and nothing to correspond in the enrolled, I draw a perpendicular line before and after it, thus: [that.]</p></item><item><p>4th. [[Illegible Text]] Where both of them omit a word or expression obviously necessary to the sense, I insert it in brackets, but with an interrogation mark, or query, thus: [that!]</p></item><item><p>5th. that! Where a wrong word or expression occurs in both, I notice it simply by an interrogation alone after it, thus: that!</p></item><item><p>6th. REF. NOTE: Is the note referring back to prior legislation, c.</p></item><item><p>7th. Sup. Ct. Decis.: Refers to the Supreme Court Decisions on that subject, c.</p></item></list></p><pre>JOHN RUTHERFORD.<br set="RIGHT" /></pre></note></notediv>

<law id="R1853V1N627" initial.page="587"><lawnbr>(No. 4.)</lawnbr><p>Mr. Clark, of the Finance Committee, to whom were referred the memorial of Joseph Sturgis, asking the payment to him of one thousand dollars, as compensation for services rendered by him, at Washington City, during two sessions of Congress, as the Agent of the State, in prosecuting her claims against the General Government, have had said memorial under consideration and beg leave to <sidenote>Report Finance Committee on claim of Judge [Illegible Text]</sidenote></p><div><title>REPORT:<br set="CENTER" /></title><p>That they are satisfied that the contract made in November, 1849, between said memorialist and Governor Towns was, that he was to have as a sum certain, five hundred dollars for each session of Congress, he should be so engaged in the service of the State. It seems that a different opinion was entertained by Governor Cobb and the Select Committee, who reported upon the same subject matter at the last session of the General Assembly, which opinion was based upon the minutes of the contract from the records of the Executive Department, where the first payment of five hundred dollars to said memorialist is termed an out-fit, and implies that that was all he was to receive from the State as certain, no matter how long he might necessarily be engaged in such service. In support of his cliam, and to show that such entry is erroncous and does not state properly the contract made with Governor Towns, the memorlists have furnished us with the several letters of George D. Phillips and David J. Bailey, who were witnesses to said contract, and also, the letter of his late Excellency, Governor Towns, who was a party to the same. <sidenote>[Illegible Text] the contract with Governor Towns.</sidenote> <sidenote>Report a mistake in the entry thereof, c.</sidenote></p><p>Dr. Phillips, says: My understanding then and all times was, that you were to receive ten per centum on the amount collected, and five hundred dollars to defray expenses, for each session of Congress, you found it necessary to devote to the business. I doubt not but you would find the entry of the contract on the Executive Journals, to have been made by one of his private Secretaries, and hence the error in stating the contract. <sidenote>Evidence of the contract.</sidenote></p><p>Col. Bailey, says: My understanding as to the pay for the services was ten per centum upon whatever amount should be collected, also five hundered dollars as a certain compensation during each session of Congress, so long as he (Sturgis,) should continue to act as the Agent of the State.</p><p>Gov. Towns, after stating all the circumstances connected with the employment of the memorialist, concludes thus: I therefore hope the present Legislature will carry out the true intent of the contract I made with you, which was $500 per session for [Illegible Text] session you were engaged in the business. <sidenote>Gov. Towns' statement.</sidenote></p><p>It is upon the foregoing evidence we report that the memorial ist was to be paid by the contract, with Governor Towns, $500 per each session of Congress he should be engaged in the service of the State, which testimony we are advised was not before Governor Cobb nor the Select Committee of the last General Assembly.</p>

<page id="GA1853.1.P586" no="GA1853.1.588" />

<p>We find that Judge Sturgis entered upon his duties on December, 1849, and is still the Agent of the State, and that he has served up to March, 1853, through and during four sessions of Congress, which, at the rate of $500 per session, would entitle him to $2,000. <sidenote>Term of service.</sidenote></p><p>Received an advance from the State of $500, as pay for his first session of service, and that for his second of service, he received from Governor Towns, on the part of the State, the additional sum of five hundred dollars, which latter payment we take as sustaining Governor Towns' remembrance of the contract, and hence his testimony fully explains why said last mentioned payment was made. <sidenote>Pay received already.</sidenote></p><p>It thus appears that there are two sessions of Congress through which Judge Sturgis has served the State, and for which he has received no pay, according to the original contract; this amounts to $1,000, the sum he asks to be paid him, and we can see no good reason why his petition should not be granted. Under the contract entered into with Governor Towns, Judge Sturgis has rendered the State efficient and valuable service. Up to the last General Assembly, he had collected for the State $72,955.24, and for the Central Bank, $21,044.00, and since that time he has collected $144,890.53. Governor Cobb in his recent annual message, says: These claims have been long standing, and the State is now indebted for the collection of a large portion of them to the energy and ability with which they have been urged by the Agent, appointed by my predecessor and continued by myself, Joseph Sturgis, Esq. <sidenote>Conclusion of Committee$1,000 due.</sidenote></p><p>Judge Sturgis' agency still continues under the contract with Governor Towns, unless it is conceded that this was terminated by the notice of Governor Cobb, that he should be allowed hereafter only the ten per centum upon the amount received, but it is clear that Governor Cobb gave said notice, under his construction of the original contract, and not as a notice of the change in the terms or the making of a new contract. It now appearing that such construction was a misapprehension, created by the peculair terms of the order in the Executive Depaatment; it follows necessarily that Judge Sturgis is still entitled to an enforcement of the original contract.</p><p>Your Committee therefore recommend to the Senate the passage of the following resolution:</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That Joseph Sturgis, Esq., is entitled to have, of the State of Georgia, the certain sum of one thousand dollars, for his services rendered the State as her Agent at Washington City, for the two last sessions of Congress, ending March, 1853, in conformity with the contract entered into with Governor Towns, to provide for the prosecution of certain claims of the State against the General Government. <sidenote>Resolution to pay him $1,000.</sidenote></p><p>On motion of Mr. Clark, the report was taken up and agreed to.</p></div><approvaldate>Approved, January 16th, 1854.</approvaldate></law><law id="R1853V1N628" initial.page="588"><lawnbr>(No. 5.)</lawnbr><p><i>Resolved,</i> by the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of Georgia, That his Excellency the Governor be and he is
