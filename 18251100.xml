It is likewise perceived that the erection of additional work shops under the direction of the principal keeper will hereafter facilitate the operations of the institution and will consequently advance with good workmen and timely supplies of raw materials its financial prosperity. The state of the main building, the hospital, the guard-house and domiciliary of the convicts evince a due degree of care and attention, but the cells for the solitary confinement of the prisoners are still in a ruinous and dilapidated state, and can (from the locality) only be restored to permanent usefulness by repairing them with stone and iron.</p><p>The books of the institution from the examination which has taken place appear to have been kept with neatness and correctness, and no remissness has been discovered in the assistant keepers and clerks in the discharge of their duties.</p><p>In looking attentively at the account current which was rendered by the principal keeper of the operations of the institution for the political year just elapsed your committee have concluded to offer the following suggestions under the belief that they will meet with proper attention.</p><p><list><item><p>1st.

In the year eighteen hundred and twenty-three the sum due the institution in notes and open accounts amounted to twelve thousand eight hundred and ninety-nine dollars fifty-four cents, and in stock on hand in raw materials and manufactured articles amounted to seven thousand eight hundred and thirty dollars forty-six and one half cents, making in the whole twenty thousand seven hundred and twenty dollars and three fourths cents. In the year eighteen hundred and twenty-four there was due the institution in notes and open accounts seventeen thousand three hundred and seventy-one dollars seventy and one fourth cents, and the stock on hand in raw materials and manufactured articles amounted to eight thousand eight hundred and seventy five dollars and fifty-one and three fourth cents, making in the whole twenty-five thousand six hundred and forty-six dollars twenty-seven cents, which was an accession to the institution for that year of four thousand nine hundred and twenty-six dollars twenty-six cents above the preceeding year. In the year eighteen hundred and twenty-five there was due the institution in notes and open accounts twenty-two thousand and five dollars sixty-seven and three fourth cents, and the stock on hand in raw materials and manufactured articles amounted to twenty-eight thousand one hundred and forty-two dollars eighty-four and one half cents, which was an accession to the fund of the institution for eighteen hundred and twenty-five of two thousand four hundred and ninety six dollars thirty-one and one-fourth cents above the preceeding year, instead of six thousand one hundred and one dollars which would have been had the increase of the capital been in the same ratio as it was in the year eighteen hundred and twenty-four.</p><p>By referring to the expose of the years of eighteen hundred and twenty-four and twenty-five and other official documents it appears that the institution in the former year has done better

<page id="GA1825.1.P203" no="GA1825.1.204" />

business for the state than in the latter year to the amount of two thousand seven hundred dollars and upwards, and that the demand upon the penitentiary fund in the treasury has been somewhat less in the former year than in the latter. The contemplated reduction of the guard mentioned by the principal keeper and consequent retrenchment of expenses (if practicable) is certainly very desirable, but as this question can only be settled by experience and by persons acquainted with a guard duty and the localities of the penitentiary edifice, your committee forbear to express any opinion upon the subject. The additional expenses for bringing more convicts to the prison in eighteen hundred and twenty-five than in eighteen hundred and twenty four, and discharging more from an estimate that has been made cannot exceed four hundred dollars, for these objects capable assistant keepers, good workmen, and a plentiful and constant supply of good materials are the chief causes which create a capability in the institution to do a good business in any year, and if any of these requisites are and have been wanting it will be felt in the year just commencing.</p><p>The inspectors of the penitentiary have stated in their report that the institution possesses in a great degree a capability of doing a better business the ensuing year than, at any former period.Your committee however, from their own observations, and from conversations held with competent judges are [Illegible Text] with a different belief.</p><approvaldate>Approved, 22d Dec. 1825.</approvaldate></law><law id="R1825V1N166" initial.page="204"><p>IN SENATE, Dec. 21, 1825.</p><p>Mr. Wooten from the committee on the State of the Republic, obtained leave to make the following Report:</p><p>The committee on the State of the Republic, in the several matters referred to their consideration, and in the documents which accompany them, find that their attention is mainly directed to our relations with the Indian tribes, who are in the temporary occupancy of our territory, and to topics connected <i>with,</i> and arising <i>out</i> of those relations.

The evidence taken against the Agent for the Creeks, and the two resolutions of the Senate, directing particular enquiries.</p><p>Your committee discover that from the proceedings which have been had, many of them delicate, and the whole important, that the treaty lately negotiated by the United States for the procurement of territory for the use of Georgia, has been placed in a situation novel and peculiar. So much evidence upon this subject has been disclosed, and the transaction so fully and so variously developed, that few, if any of the citizens of Georgia, remain at this day unapprised of the difficulties which have been opposed to the consummation of our rights, upon the subject of territory. These rights are too extensive and too immediately connected with the present and future interests of Georgia to allow for a moment the existence of [Illegible Text] of feeling or the neutrality of sentiment. It may well be regarded as a misfortune, that these rights require to be sought through a double contest with the government of the United States, and two of the most powerful Indian tribes. Such contest becomes embarrassing and of doubtful

<page id="GA1825.1.P205" no="GA1825.1.206" />

issue, in proportion to the number of parties engaged, the different policy adopted, and the number of interests involved.When the compact of eighteen hundred and two was entered into between Georgia and the General Government, it was well hoped that the arrangement would have speedily resulted, as was the intent, in the complete fulfillment of the wishes of Georgia. But notwithstanding the great consideration paid by Georgia for the compact, the beneficial manner in which it has operated to the United States, and the increasing obligations imposed thereby, your committee regret to have observed the lapse of upwards of twenty-three years; and that our march has been so slow, and beset by so many opposing difficulties. It was to have been expected that difficulties would increase with delay; and on this account the delay which has occurred, is the more to be [Illegible Text] when, in 1823-4, so prompt and liberal an appropriation was made to defray the expences of a treaty with the Creeks, expectations were extensively indulged, that as relating to that tribe, the question would be put to rest. Commissioners were selected from our own citizens; they were instructed to consult the wishes of Georgia in any cession applied for; a new policy was disclosed and earnestly recommended by the administration of the General Government, so benevolent and so beneficial to the Indians, that its rejection appeared impossible. All preparatory arrangements seemed to be well deviseda meeting is had, which results unfavorablythe General Government gives to the Commissioners fresh instructions, and imparts new energies to the negociationa treaty is obtained under the usual formalities, and passes to ratification under the most solemn forms, and against the protest and exertions of its chief opposer. The treaty before and after its negociation, was acquiesced in universally by the nationand your committee doubt not, would have gone into uninterrupted execution, but for unwarrantable, illicit interference. A treaty thus negociated, thus ratified and thus acquiesced in, and your committee would add, so beneficial to all parties concerned and bearing on its face such conclusive evidence of fairness your committee cannot but regard as operating the <i>vestment</i> of rights in the state of Georgia, which can no otherwise be <i>divested</i> than by her act and consent. Your committee are the more confirmed in this conclusion, from the evidence which they have invoked from the usage of Indian negociations. Having long occupied the position of a frontier state, and as long been interested in the extinguishment of Indian titles, there are few Georgians who, at this day, are ignorant of the customs of the neighboring tribes, and of the facility with which they are made the dupes of wily and perfidious white men. There are amongst them, many of this description, a few degrees removed from barbarity, to be sure, but in the retrogade order, having left a name whence they

<page id="GA1825.1.P206" no="GA1825.1.207" />

secretly emigrated, easy to be found and read in the criminal record. These are willing instruments in the hands of [Illegible Text] to better and higher grade; and in these are concentrated the controlling influence of the mass of the nation. Their own interest is conserved in every effort which they make in resisting the policy of the government; and these efforts, and the manner of sustaining them, are independent of the suggestions of a moral sense. An act of treachery committed, an act of felony succeeds to uphold it. Regarding this as but a just picture of the elements of the Creek Nation, your committee express no surprise at any opposition by which attempts to acquire territory are met, or of any of the means resorted to for the purpose of defeating interests which are interruptive of their own. In the documents referred, your committee find evident traces of the existence of those feelings and these principles, and if they were now reporting to a tribunal which could extend relief, they should consider themselves as expressing a sentiment of benevolence, by recommending, that the untutored savage should be left untutored still, rather than be made to study the maxims of sinister wisdom under a regenerate master. Your committee are sufficiently aware of the enlarged policy of benevolence, by which the general government is disposed to characterise its intercourse with the Indian tribes. By questioning the manner of practising the motive, they would not be considered as depreciating the motive itself. Your committee then, will not withhold the recommendation, that in furtherance of the interest of the Indians themselves, and in conformity with the rights of Georgia, that our Senators in Congress be instructed, and our Representatives requested to use their exertions to have the Indians within our limits removed with the least possible delay. And that to this end, they endeavor to procure the passage of a law, which shall treat these tribes as dependents, as they in fact are, which shall point the way to their own preservation, and command them to pursue it. That is a doubtful benevolence which indulges its object in a violation or a caprice which tends to his own extermination. That benevolence is still more doubtful, which surrenders its objects to be the victims of misrule and profligacy. Your committee could not object that Georgia, as a member of the union, should bear her part in the great scheme of redemption, which is extending to the race of heathens: but as this is the work of the nation, let it be performed on national soil, and not on that which has been individualized in Georgia by the solemn compact, through which she derives her title. If there be any virtue in imparting civilization by [Illegible Text] proximity of settlement, Georgia is content with the opportunity that has been thus long afforded her, and will not insist on further monopoly; and she would have been the more gratified with the good she has done, if it had not been so poorly required by the

<page id="GA1825.1.P207" no="GA1825.1.208" />

murderous aggressions of her savage neighbors. In no light in which our relations with the Indians and the general government can be viewed, can we perceive any justice in being longer kept out from the occupancy of our soilout to our limits in every direction. We have paid for it many prices, and should have delivered to us that which is ours.</p><p>As relating then to the matters referred, touching the late treaty, the manner in which it has been questioned, and its present standing, your committee recommend the following resolutions:</p><p><i>Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of Georgia, in General Assembly met,</i> That full reliance is and ought to be placed in the late treaty concluded between the United States for the use of Georgia, and the Creek Nation of Indians, at the Indian Springs. That the title of the territory obtained by said treaty within the limits of Georgia, is considered as an absolute, vested interest, and that nothing short of the whole territory thus acquired, will be satisfactory, and that the right of entry immediately, upon the expiration of the time limited in the treaty, be insisted on, and accordingly carried into effect. As respects the reference to your committee, directing them to [Illegible Text] into the expediency of requesting the removal of the Agent for Indian Affairs, your committee considering the ample view taken of the subject at the extra session of the Legislature of the present year, by the report of your committee of the state of the republic deem it unnecessary to say more on the subject, than to express their concurrence in the sentiments and wishes therein contained, and to repeat their opinion, as the representatives of the people of this state, that the interest of the state of Georgia, and the policy of the General Government, require that Col. John Crowell, the present Agent of Indian Affairs, should be removed from office; and they do therefore request of the government of the United States, his immediate removal.</p><p>The correspondence conducted by the Executive and the two Agents of the general government, T. P. Andrews and General Gaines, and with the general government itself, is also made matter of reference to your committee, and remains to be noticed.</p><p>Your committee would remark of the whole of this correspondence, that it contains much which need not be made matter of specific reportSuch portions may well be left between the parties themselves, and to public observation. There are certain other portions, however, disclosing facts which have already had their operation, and of evil tendency to the rights of Georgia.Of this nature, were the proceedings at Broken Arrow in June last, where, and for the first time, we hear of the Indians complaining of the invalidity of the Treaty in the use of the borrowed words, that it was [Illegible Text] alike with intrigue and treachery. A report of the doubtful evidence thus acquired when no one was

present to defend the validity of the Treaty, and when every art which cunning could design, or wickedness suggest, was put in exercise to defend the Agent by attacking the Treaty, and the means of its obtainment, seems to have formed the ground of the reference to Congress by the President. Your committee therefore selecting so much of said correspondence as furnishes the fact of the reference of the Treaty to Congress, and the grounds upon which such reference was made, consider it within the scope of their duty to report, that such proceedings form the cause of just Protest on the part of the state of Georgia. It is impossible from the organization of the Creek nation and the state of excitement which prevailed at the time, that the truth could have been arrived at by any <i>ex parte</i> proceeding of such satisfactory and undisguised character, as to bring into question the rights of Georgia, as secured by the Treaty. Against the proceeding then by which the facts purport to have been ascertained, and against the proceeding founded thereon, of referring the Treaty for reconsideration, your committee consider it proper that Georgia should enter her most solemn <i>Protest.</i> If there is to be a revision, it is due to the interest and rights of the state, that she should be represented in the entire proceedings, as well preparatory as final.</p><approvaldate>Approved, 23d Dec. 1825.</approvaldate></law><law id="R1825V1N167" initial.page="209"><p>IN SENATE, 21st Dec. 1825.</p><p>The joint committee on agriculture and internal improvement to whom was referred the reports of the commissioners for the improvement of the navigation of Tugalo river, have [Illegible Text] the same under their consideration, and on a mature examination of the reports, find</p><p>That they have made use of their best endeavors to make such improvements on the river as the situation of the water and weather would admit of during the last summer.</p><p>And your committee find further on examination of the reports of said commissioners that there remains in their hands the sum of one thousand and nine dollars and twenty-eight cents unexpended.

Your committee deem that the enterprise is worthy of a public appropriation of competent amount to effect the object. The Chattahoochee ridge is very formidable, and is a great obstacle in the way of the western trade. The ridge at the contemplated point is more easy of improvement than at any other upon the barrier between Tennessee and Georgia, and such passage would greatly facilitate the transportation from that quarter. In a local point of view, such road would be a great convenience, but forms the least inducement to the performance of the work.
