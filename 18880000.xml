In case the owner of the land is under disabilities as mentioned in this section, and without legal representative, the Ordinary may give notice for such disabled person, and in the same manner, service may be given in a similar case to the Ordinary where the company may enter an appeal. An issue shall be made on the appeal aud tried in the Superior Court as common law cases are tried, with the right of either party to except and carry same to Supreme Court. If the appeal is entered by the railway company, it shall give bond with security for the payment of the amount adjudged on the final hearing. But the land so condemned or sought to be condemned shall not be used or occupied by the railroad company until just and reasonable compensation is paid to the owner thereof, or the amount of the award deposited in cash in a solvent bank in Georgia subject to the final judgment in the case, and a bond also given to pay all eventual condemnation money, if any over and above the amount of the award so deposited. Upon a compliance with these provisions the railroad company may proceed to take and use the land or right-of-way sought to be condemned, and this provision shall apply in the case of either the owner of the land or the railroad company appealing. Should no
