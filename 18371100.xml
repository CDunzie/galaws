be made amenable to the violated laws of the State, and the refusal of the Governor of Maine to comply with said demand, <i>Report:</i></p><p>That said Committee have fully viewed all the circumstances attending said demand and refusal; that, in the opinion of said Committee, the Governor of Maine has signally failed to show any good and sufficient cause to justify him in refusing to comply with the just and reasonable demand of the Executive of Georgia; but that, on the contrary, the reply of the Governor of Georgia to the letter of refusal of the Governor of Maine, contains argumentsunanswerable argumentswhich should at once have caused that officer, if at all disposed to comply with the requisitions of the constitution of the United States, by performing the sacred duties which it imposed upon him, or to preserve that courtesy which should ever subsist between the sister States of this Union, upon any and every subject, however trifling it might be in its nature, but more particularly upon questions of such grave import as the one now under consideration, to have caused said fugitives to be arrested, and the necessary notice of such arrest given to the Governor of Georgia, so that they might be made to answer the charges preferred against them; and if innocent, to vindicate their innocenceif guilty, to endure the just punishment of their crimes.</p><p>The refusal of Governor Dunlap, occurring at a period when the minds of the people of the South are justly excited, and their feelings most wantonly outraged, by the machinations of cartain fanatics of the North, who seem determined, in defiance of sound policy and the dictates of honest patriotism, and of every principle of natural and constitutional law, to keep up an excitement in relation to a certain species of property, with which no interference from any quarter whatsoever will be permitteda property guarantied to them by the constitution of the United States, and without which guarantee this Union never would have been formed, appears, in the opinion of your Committee, if not like a disposition on the part of the Governor of the State of Maine to foster and encourage said fanatics in their unholy crusade against southern rights, and which, if persisted in, must inevitably lead to a speedy dissolution of the Union, at least like an inclination to wink at their proceedings, by screening their miserable agents, who alone carry their doctrines into practical effect, by wanton depredations upon our property, from the justice of our laws. The reasoning of his Excell ncy of Maine, in his letter of refusal to the demand of the Governor of Georgia, is, in the opinion of your Committee, entirely fallacious, and evasive of the true question at issue. The affidavit of the owner of the stolen slave, directly charges that the fugitives did, on or

<page id="GA1837.1.P282" no="GA1837.1.284" />

about the fourth day of May, eighteen hundred and thirty-seven, <i>feloniously enveigle, steal, take and carry away</i>, a negro slave; with having, after the commission of said felony, <i>fled from the State;</i> and that they were believed at the time to be within the limits of the State of Maine. Is it for one moment to be presumed that the Governor of the State of Maine was not aware that larceny is made, by the laws of every State in the Union, felony; unless, indeed, it may not so be by those of Maine? That State, indeed, may have, in tender mercy to thieves and incendiaries, declared it otherwise; but this your Committee does not, and cannot believe. Whether, however, felony or not, by the laws of Maine, is it not a crime? It is so declared by the penal code of the State of Georgia, which fact was communicated to the Governor of Maine, by the Governor of Georgia. Has, then, the Governor of Maine done that which not only common courtesy, but justice, policy, patriotism and imperative duty, required him to perform? Has he complied with the stern requisitions of the constitution of the United States, which he was sworn to support and defend? No! but he has disregarded and violated all. The act of Congress, passed February 12th, 1793, respecting fugitives from justice, and persons escaping from the services of their mastersan act passed in furtherance of the second section of the fourth article of the constitution, which says, a person charged in any State with treason, <i>felony</i>, or <i>other crime</i>, who shall flee from justice, and be found in another State, shall, on demand of the Executive authority of the State from which he fled, be delivered up, to be removed to the State having jurisdiction of the crimeexpressly and peremptorily declares, that whenever the Executive authority of any State in the Union, or of either of the Territories northwest or south of the river Ohio, shall demand any person as a <i>fugitive from justice</i>, of the Executive authority of any such State or Territory, to which such person shall have fled, and shall moreover produce the copy of an indictment found, <i>or an affidavit made</i> before a magistrate of any State or Territory, as aforesaid, charging the person so demanded with having committed treason, <i>felony, or other crime</i>, certified as authentic by the Governor or Chief Magistrate of the State or Territory from whence the person so charged fled, it shall be the duty of the Executive authority of the State or Territory to which such person shall have fled, to cause him or her to be arrested and secured, and notice of the arrest to be given to the Executive authority making such demand, or to the agent of such authority appointed to receive the fugitive, and to cause the fugitive to be delivered to such agent, when he shall appear; and further provides, that if no such agent shall appear within six months from the time of such arrest, the prisoner may be discharged, c.</p>

<page id="GA1837.1.P283" no="GA1837.1.285" />

<p>Now, by referring to documents hereunto annexed, it will appear that every requisition of the above recited act was strictly complied with by the Executive of Georgia. But the Governor of Maine, in his anxious desire to find an excuse for not doing his duty, says, so far as he has received any information relative to Philbrook and Kelleran, their visit to Georgia was in the course of their ordinary business as mariners; their vessel being at the South, they navigated it homeward by the usual route, and in the usual time; they had stated homes, to which they openly returned; at those homes they took up their residence, and conducted their affairs there without concealment, and in all respects conformably to the usage of innocent and unsuspecting citizens. Whether such a course of conduct is to be considered a fleeing from justice, within the meaning of the act of Congress, and whether men so conducting, are to be viewed as fugitives, may present a question of some importance, which he does not deem it necessary for him to decide. Truly, a most wise conclusion! But the Governor of Maine seems to claim it as a matter of right, for him to depend upon information which he received, for refusing to deliver the fugitivesinformation, perhaps falseagainst a positive oath! Surely, then, your Committee, speaking in behalf of the people of Georgia, if not of the entire South, may be permitted, also, to rely upon information which they have received, for reasons (independent of those already given,) why they <i>should</i> have been delivered.</p><p>The vessel of the fugitives left, it appears, the port of Savannah in the usual manner; she pursued the usual trackthat of the broad ocean (the only one she could possibly pursue)to reach her port of destination; she arrived in the usual time; and, as the Governor of Maine <i>would have us believe</i>, they took up their residences at their <i>usual homes</i>. On the other hand, your Committee is informed upon good authority, that when the owner, who went in pursuit of the stolen slave, arrived at the port to which the fugitives fledto wit: their <i>homes</i>they themselves could not be found, although their vessel was lying in the port. The slave they did find, <i>concealed in a barn;</i> and, that when the party who arrested him, were about leaving with the recovered property, they were pelted by the populace, and the owner with difficulty escaped from the fury of the mob.</p><p>But it is unnecessary to dilate further. All the facts of the case show conclusively, that the Governor of Maine, if not disposed at the time of the demand to comply with it for want of information, that he should have done so on the reception of Governor Schley's second letter. To that letter, no reply, so far as your Committee is informed, has ever been received. Compelled, therefore, from all these circumstances, to believe

<page id="GA1837.1.P284" no="GA1837.1.286" />

that the constituted authorities of Maine do not mean to comply with the laws and constitution of the country, but in total disregard of both; to treat with contempt the just demands of Georgia, all that remains for your Committee to perform, is to suggest the remedy. This is indeed a delicate and difficult task. We cannot close our ports against the vessels of Maine. We cannot declare a non-intercourse with her citizens. Either course would be clearly unconstitutional. To seize upon the persons of her citizens as hostages, or to levy upon their property found in our State, by way of reprisal, would also be unconstitutional; but if not, it would be unjust, because it would be punishing the innocent for the guilty. What, then, ought to be done? Resort to the <i>ultima ratio?</i> This, in the language of Governor Schley, cannot be resorted to, without a violation of the federal compact; and long, long may it be before the States of this Union shall be involved in civil conflict. But knowing that this dreadful alternative must inevitably be ultimately resorted to, as a matter of self-defence by the people of the South, in case the unhallowed example of the Governor of Maine be followed by the authorities of the other States of the North, and willing to prove to the world by our forbearance, our reverence for the constitutiona forbearance which it is hoped will hereafter ensure us justiceyour Committee, although strongly disposed to recommend the passage of a law imposing a quarantine upon all vessels coming into our waters from the State of Maine, in consequence of viewing the doctrine of abolition as a moral and political pestilence, which, if not checked, will spread devastation and ruin over the land at this time, simply recommend the adoption of the following resolutions:</p><p><i>Be it therefore unanimously Resolved, by the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of Georgia, in General Assembly met</i>, That the refusal, on the part of the Governor of the State of Maine, to deliver up, or cause to be delivered up, upon the demand of the Governor of this State, Daniel Philbrook and Edward Kelleran, who stand charged with the commission of a crime against the laws of this State, and have fled therefrom, is not only <i>dangerous</i> to the rights of the people of Georgia, but <i>clearly</i> and directly in <i>violation</i> of the plain letter of <i>the constitution of the United States</i>, which is in the following words, to wit: A person charged in any State with treason, <i>felony</i>, or <i>other crime</i>, who shall flee from justice, and be found in another State, shall, on the demand of the Executive authority of the State from which he fled, be delivered up, to be removed to the State having jurisdiction of the crime.</p><p><i>Be it further unanimously resolved</i>, That the State of Georgia, and each of the other members of this confederacy, by the adoption of the federal constitution, became a party thereto no

less for the better protection of <i>her own</i>, than the <i>common rights and interests of all;</i> and when these ends cease to be attained, by the faithlessness of any to the <i>constitutional engagement</i>, she is no longer <i>bound by any obligations to the common compact;</i> and it <i>then</i> becomes not only her right, but her <i>duty</i>, paramount to <i>all others</i>, to seek and provide protection for her <i>own people, in her own way</i>.</p><p><i>And be it further unanimously resolved</i>, That so soon as a bill of indictment shall be found true, in the Superior Court of Chatham county, against the said Daniel Philbrook and Edward Kelleran, for the offence aforesaid, the Executive of Georgia be requested to make, upon the Executive of Maine, a second demand for the persons of the said fugitives, predicated upon said bill of indictment, and accompanied by such evidence as is contemplated by the act of Congress, in such cases made and provided.</p><p><i>And be it further unanimously resolved</i>, That should the Executive of Maine refuse to comply with such second demand, the Executive of Georgia be requested to transmit a copy of these resolutions to the Executive of each State in the Union, to be presented to their several Legislatures, and also a copy to the President of the United States, and to our Senators and Representatives in Congress, to be laid before that body. And should the Legislature of Maine, at its next session after the said resolutions shall have been forwarded to the Executive of that State, neglect to redress the grievance hereinbefore set forth, it shall be the duty of the Executive of Georgia to announce the same by Proclamation, and call upon the people of the several counties, on a day, in said Proclamation to be named, to elect, under like regulations and restrictions as in the election of members to the Legislature, a number of delegates, equal to the number of Senators and Representatives to which they may be entitled in the General Assembly, to meet in Convention at the seat of Government, on a day to be fixed in said Proclamation, to take into consideration the state of the Commonwealth of Georgia, and to devise the course of her future policy, and provide all necessary safeguards, for the protection of the rights of her people.</p><p>In the House of Representatives, agreed to, Dec. 22d, 1837.</p><p>JOSEPH DAY,</p><p>Speaker of the House of Representatives,</p><p>AttestJoseph Sturgis, Clerk.</p><p>In Senate, concurred in, Dec. 25th, 1837.</p><p>ROBERT M.
