The Planters' Bank, though involved in some embarrassing difficulties with the branch of the United States' Bank in Savannah, has made a report evincing the most wholesome condition. The State and Darien Banks, though the [Illegible Text] against them bear a greater proportion to their means of paying, are still considered as being in a state of unquestionable solvency; and it is a pleasing reflection, that amidst the trying difficulties which have surrounded the commercial part of the community, a diminution of the usual dividends declared on the stock, is the greatest evil likely to result from the present embarrassments of the Banks.</p><p>Your committee ask leave further to reportThat the state of Georgia, by the establishment of her banking institutions, had two great objects in view.The one to furnish to her citizens a safe and convenient medium of circulation, to the exclusion of the bills of the Banks of other states: the other, to enable her to have the funds of the state profitably invested in bank stock.</p><p>Both of these objects have either entirely failed or have been considerably abridged, by the operations of the office of the Bank of the United States at Savannah, which in the opinion of your committee, having been <i>[Illegible Text]</i> upon the state of Georgia without her consent, is an interference with her sovereignty as an independent state.</p><p>Because the aforesaid office of the Bank of the United States, located at Savannah, [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] a long time refuse to issue its bills, and by [Illegible Text] the bills of the State Banks, as the depository of the revenue of the United States, and by other means perfectly within its power, has not only taken from the state her medium of circulation for her valuable products, but by frequent and repeated demands for large [Illegible Text] <i>in [Illegible Text]</i> upon the state banks, had well nigh drained their [Illegible Text], thereby [Illegible Text] their destruction, and compelling them, in order to meet [Illegible Text] <i>[Illegible Text],</i> to curtail their discounts, insomuch as to [Illegible Text] the state and the individual stockholders of their usual and expected dividends.</p><p>[Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] a [Illegible Text] of things, your committee would [Illegible Text] no step which [Illegible Text] array the state against the authorities of the United

States, or injure the credit of the bills of the Banks of the State of Georgia. They would advise all collision with the Bank of the United States to be eschewed if possible. But a proper regard to the safety of their own institutions, demands and imperiously requires that something should be done for their protection.</p><p>Your committee, therefore, recommend that a law shall be passed establishing a rate of interest between the United States' Bank and the Banks of the state of Georgia, below the present legal rate of interest of the state, and so low as to prevent the said Banks from being benefitted by an accumulation of the bills of each other: for which purpose your committee recommend the passage of a law.</p><p>And further, your committee recommend, that while the State Banks shall rigidly persevere in paying their bills in specie to all individuals applying therefor, who may not be agents of the Bank of the United States or either of its branches, that they shall refuse, whenever they may think it prudent so to do, to pay specie for their bills to the United States' Bank, or its offices or agents, upon giving sixty days previous notice of such intention.</p><p>And your committee confidently hope that <i>public opinion</i> will bear the state institutions out in such a course of conduct, as none other seems in the mind of your committee to be calculated to save the state institutions eventually from utter annihilation, under existing circumstances, to the great injury of the state and of the individuals who are or may be stockholders in the aforesaid banking establishments.</p><approvaldate>Approved, 22d December, 1821.</approvaldate></law><law id="R1821V2N133" initial.page="131"><p>IN SENATE, 17<i>th December,</i> 1821.</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That Robert W.

on the subject of the appropriation of the public lands, by the Congress of the United States, for the purposes of education,</p><p>REPORT:</p><p>That they are deeply impressed with a sense of the importance of the subject and venture an opinion on it with great diffidence. They will however present a succinct statement of their views without pretending to make any display of argument or research beyond what is furnished by the documents referred.</p><p>It is believed that no nation has produced as many testimonials of a desire for the universal diffusion of knowledge as the United States.</p><p>This has been evinced in every way by the States individually, and by their Representatives in Congress; and it is with grateful pride we can say that if the United States have not reared the temple of knowledge to an unexampled height and splendor, she has laid its foundation on a base broad as humanity, and durable, it is hoped, as any of the works of men. A system of education having for its object the instruction of every individual in a great nation, was reserved as an achievement for the United States of America. That there is in this nation a moral power that will finally accomplish this great end, we most fondly hope. That it has been procrastinated by adverse circumstances is true; but it is believed that divided councils and a want of system have been the great impediments to this great work. So far as a system of public instruction has taken root amongst us it has been left to the exclusive management of the individual states; and in the present state of the science of education, we are led to think this the most eligible plan. The states have also been left to furnish the necessary funds in their own way; but an exception has been made to this in favor of the states admitted into the Union since the revolutionary war. To these, the United States have made large grants of public land to be used by them as a perpetual fund for the purposes of public education.</p><p>Your committee will not question the policy of these large grants, nor will they question the authority of the United States to make them. But they think it may well be questioned how far these benefits should be granted exclusively to the newly admitted states.</p><p>We deem it useless to detail the many differences of opinion which have existed in the United States with regard to the title to the unappropriated lands within the chartered limits of several of the states at the commencement of the revolutionary war. These disputes which were at one time so just a source of alarm, have been finally brought to a happy adjustment. The territory of each state is accurately defined, and it is universally conceded that the remaining country is the common property of the Union. This opinion it is believed is sanctioned by justice and policy, and the people of the United States look to their unlocated territory as a mean of raising money for national purposes.</p><p>The ordinance appropriating one thirty-sixth part of the public lands of the United States for the purpose of common schools within the district containing such land, appears to have passed as carly as the year 1785. From that to the present time, the plan appears to have been pursued with large additional appropriations for a similar purpose. This

<page id="GA1821.2.P135" no="GA1821.2.136" />

system having been quietly [Illegible Text] in for a long time, would not [Illegible Text] to [Illegible Text] its supporters, and accordingly we find it defended and justified by one Legislature, and a committee of the Senate of the United States, by a strange [Illegible Text] come to the conclusion-that, the [Illegible Text] granted to some of the new states for the purposes of education, though [Illegible Text] in common [Illegible Text] by the [Illegible Text] of donations, were in fact sales bottomed upon valuable considerations. It will be thought strange that those considerations are no other than a want of power in the state to tax the public lands, or lands sold by the United States to individuals but for a [Illegible Text] time: powers which having never vested in the states, could hardly be [Illegible Text] as a consideration in any kind of compact. A more [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] is advanced by the [Illegible Text] of New York. They justify the [Illegible Text] and approve the policy of these reserves by a supposed increase of the value of the remaining lands in consequence of the reservation. We who have witnessed a great tide of emigration to one of he new states are bound to doubt whether the reserves for the purposes of education either enhanced the prices of lands or encreased the number of emigrants. On the contrary, we doubt very much the [Illegible Text] of public reserves of this description, and think it by no means the best mode of raising revenue for the support of [Illegible Text] schools. But, however this may be viewed, we can only consider the grants in the light of so much money appropriated, and cannot see why the [Illegible Text] states should be excluded from the benefits thencearising. Nor can we fear the consequences of expressing this opinion. It is far from our wish to agitate any question which may have a tendency to produce [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] by geographical distinctions. But in this claim of justice we cannot fear any thing like an acrimonious opposition from the Western States. Being clearly of opinion that we have justice on our side, and that the claim will not be abandoned by the people of the older states, we think it can never be urged at a time likely to produce less excitement than the present. Another view of this subject will strengthen the justice of our claim. Public education is rendered more difficult and expensive in proportion as a smaller population is spread over a larger surface. The settlement of the newly acquired territory tends greatly to dimish the value of our property and to thin the ranks of our people. These disadvantages we cannot but feel, however we may glory in that prosperity and policy which is destined in a short time to cover a vast wilderness with the people of our country. [Illegible Text] in the consummation of this great object we cannot [Illegible Text] forego one of the greatest advantages that can arise from it. Therefore,</p><p><i>Be it resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of Georgia, in General Assembly met,</i> That each of the United States has an equal right to participate in all the advantages arising from the public lands, the common property of the Union; and that his Excellency the Governor is hereby requested to transmit to our Senators and Representatives in Congress, copies of this preamble and resolution.</p><approvaldate>Approved, 22d December, 1821.</approvaldate></law>

concede that the district of Columbia, having no state rights of its own, is emphatically the object of the [Illegible Text] and favor of all the states, as being the proud ground upon which the national government labors for our common good, and as consecrated by, and being intended to [Illegible Text] the name of the illustrious Washington; yet your committee cannot [Illegible Text] the repeal of the law of Georgia, enacted to prevent the sale of lottery tickets within her limits. Such [Illegible Text] in favor of the district of Columbia, might be tantamount to a total repeal in its operation, as it would open the door to much [Illegible Text]. The reasons of policy and right which led to the enactment of the law in question, have been ratified by experience, and any relaxation which might tend to defeat [Illegible Text] salutary provisions, ought to be avoided. The committee, therefore, offer for adoption the following resolution:</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That the prayer of the Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Council of the city of Washington, in the premises, be refused.</p><approvaldate>Approved, 22d December, 1821.</approvaldate></law><law id="R1821V2N195" initial.page="150"><p>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 14<i>th Nov.</i> 1821.</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That the committee on printing be directed to contract for the printing of one hundred and fifty copies of the memorial of the [Illegible Text] of the University of Georgia.</p><approvaldate>Approved, 28th November, 1821.</approvaldate></law><law id="R1821V2N196" initial.page="150"><p>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 20<i>th Dec.</i> 1821.</p><p>The select committee, to whom was referred the communication of his Excellency the Governor, upon the subject of claims which accrued in [Illegible Text] of certain of our citizens for [Illegible Text] services, rendered in the year seventeen hundred and ninety-two, three, and four, under the authority of the President of the United States, have bestowed upon the reference an attention if not proportioned to the importance of the subject, at least as extensive as their time would admit. Your committee cannot withold an expression of their surprise, that services rendered under such high sanctions, at such hazardous periods, and so beneficial in their results, should have passed so long even without the scanty requital which constitutes the soldier's pay.

remembered but to be disregarded. Your memorialists cherish no belief that this protracted neglect has proceeded from a [Illegible Text] intention to practice towards Georgia an act of injustice; and yet they are at a loss to assign a reasonable apology for the frequent rejection of such well founded demands. Georgia, from her exposed and frontier situation, has perhaps found it necessary to sustain more of the cruelties and sufferings incident to Indian aggression, than any state in the union. Although she was one of the original confederation, and bore her full portion of the burthen by which the [Illegible Text] were oppressed, yet the treaty of peace of seventeen hundred and eighty-three did not furnish that repose which resulted to others of the states, and which she so ardently wished.</p><p>Her agonies were of longer duration, and were not alleviated by the reflection that she was suffering in the cause of liberty. Her enemy was savage, and her warfare was for protection only. Your memorialists proceed to enumerate the grounds of their reliance for success.</p><p>In the year seventeen hundred and ninety-two, the [Illegible Text] of the state, which was [Illegible Text] by savages, was upwards of four hundred miles in extent. The [Illegible Text] and Cherokee Nations [Illegible Text] numerous and warlike, and wrought up to desperation by [Illegible Text] defeats, and the total discomfiture of a more formidable foe, [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] they had lately been in close alliance.</p><p>It was against these that Georgia had to make her defence; she was young, her population sparse, and her resources [Illegible Text]: yet being a member of the union, she was entitled to protection. With a view to its attainment, a communication was made to the only authority capable of affording aid. In the fall of that year the Secretary of War, under the directions of the President, vested the Governor of Georgia with a discretion suited to the exigency, which discretion was exercised in a demand upon the Agent of the United States for furnishing supplies, to provide [Illegible Text] at different stations, for the militia that might be called into service. The obedience which the agent yielded to the demand, is at least conclusive that he did not question his authority, and the additional fact that the general government paid the [Illegible Text] of the supplies, is conclusive that the authority existed, and that it was of the highest order. Your memoralists see no distinction between the obligation to pay for the supplies, and the services rendered by those who received them.</p><p>Rations and pay are inseparable, and form the necessary [Illegible Text] of a soldier in service. Under the same authority a line of forts were built, from the sea [Illegible Text] to the mountains, and [Illegible Text] by [Illegible Text] force. This plan was in pursuance of the authority delegated, which required that the operations should be purely defensive. If Georgia had conducted the enterprise without dependence and without restraint, its character would have been different. The murders and aggressions of the spring of seventeen hundred and ninety-three, made those tribes the objects of [Illegible Text] vengeance, and a war of extermination, if in any case, would have been here justifiable. But the state having no original authority of her own, [Illegible Text] her conformity to the rules

which were prescribed. Being a mere agent, she had but to execute the will of her principal, and that will was expressed under limitations which cost the lives of many of our citizens. These limitations are to be found in a communication from the war department, dated in May, seventeen hundred and ninety-three, where from considerations of policy, Georgia was directed to avoid offensive expeditions. These considerations of policy were not predicated upon the safety of our state, but were [Illegible Text] upon our relations with foreign powers, and the pendency of [Illegible Text] with the northern Indians. [Illegible Text] facts are adverted to for the purpose of shewing, with the greater [Illegible Text], that Georgia did not act for herself, but that she was paying [Illegible Text] to her federal head. Another circumstance carries this position [Illegible Text] disputethere is not to be found in our [Illegible Text] book, or file, or of record in the State of Georgia any legislative authority for the service which was rendered during those periods; no one, however, doubts either the performance of the service, or its hazard and [Illegible Text]. The only question to be [Illegible Text] is, who is responsible for the expence.</p><p>Your memorialists, in disclaiming all liability on the part of Georgia, will ever [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] a most solemn [Illegible Text] rests upon the United States. An obligation doubly [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] as it does, the faith of the [Illegible Text] and [Illegible Text] pledge of [Illegible Text] Republic's father. Instances are not wanting to prove, that the like service during the same periods, and rendered under the like authority, has been compensated from the general [Illegible Text]. Georgia was [Illegible Text] alone, during those times of trial, in her exposure to the incursions of savages. The state of South Carolina, the north and south western territories, which have since been divided into rich and flourishing states, have had their periods of hostility; and although they past the boundary of <i>defensive</i> warfare, and actually invaded the enemy's country, and this too against orders, yet these have never been reduced to the [Illegible Text] necessity of repeating their application. If we be told that we have slumbered over [Illegible Text] rights, and that our demand is stale, we answer, that as between governments we know no limitation, [Illegible Text] that the subject has been frequently brought to public notice by [Illegible Text] able and [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] of the state. It may be the misfortune of Georgia, that the [Illegible Text] of the performance of these services is not so full and [Illegible Text] as could be wished, but the defect proceeds from no [Illegible Text] of her own. It may be her further misfortune, that she is compelled so often to repeat [Illegible Text] application; but this does not impair the strength of her claims. She renews the subject on this occasion under increased hopes of success; believing that there is no [Illegible Text] on the part of the general government to withhold from our state the things that are hers.</p><p>Your [Illegible Text] beg leave to refer to the following documents, in support of their views upon the subject under investigation:</p><p>[Illegible Text] from the [Illegible Text] of War to the Governor of Georgia, [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text], [Illegible Text].</p><p>[Illegible Text] letter between the same parties, dated the [Illegible Text] of May, [Illegible Text].</p>
