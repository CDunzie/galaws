In response thereto, the General Assembly raised a Joint Committee of thirteen to make the investigation demanded, with instructions to report not only the conclusions at which it shall have arrived, but also the evidence on which the conclusions are based. The Committee having thoroughly investigated the whole matter, beg leave, in obedience to instructions, to submit the accompanying evidence and to report the following conclusions: In reference to the evidence submitted the Committee state that, as printed, it is as nearly correctly reported as possible, under the circumstances, which were rendered embarrassing by the severe and continued illness of the reporter first employed, and rendered more embarrassing by the fact that the first reporter used a short-hand system not familiar to any other reporter whom the Committee could procure. But the Committee state that to their knowledge no substantial fact or statement has been omitted from the report of said evidence. In order to arrive at the issues involved, the Governor was requested to specify the charges made against him in connection

Murphy, who, it is said, was employed to procure the endorsement of the bonds. The nature of the charges coupled me with the fee that John W. Murphy received, and that it was the motive which controlled me in my endorsement of the bonds.</p><p>Your Committee, from the want of any evidence sustaining such charges, and from the mass of evidence disproving such charges, report this conclusion: That his Excellency deserves, at the hands of the General Assembly, complete vindication on the issues made by him, and specified above. Your Committee have unanimously concluded that his Excellency did not, in any way shape or form, participate in the fee received by Mr. John W. Murphy; that no offer of any such thing was made by any one to his Excellency; that said fee did not control his conduct in said endorsement, and that, whether the act of endorsement was legal or illegal, the motives of the Governor were pure.</p><p>In closing this report, the Committee submit this resolution:</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That the conclusions of this Committee be adopted as the sense of the General Assembly of Georgia. <sidenote>Adoption of report</sidenote></p><p>J.
