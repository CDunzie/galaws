Sec. IV.

The commissioners, during the trial of any criminal case, may order the trial to cease, and the accused bound over to the Superior Court, if in their judgment the crime of which he is guilty is a felony. <sidenote>Parties bound over for misdemeanor shall appear at County Court.</sidenote> <sidenote>In cases of felony.</sidenote></p><p>212. Sec. V. That when any person charged with a misdemeanor is brought before the County Court, if the accused shall in writing demand an indictment by a grand jury, the Court shall require of him bond with good security, to appear and answer to such indictment (if found) before the County Court from term to term, until discharged by its leave. If a party accused shall not ask a continuance, or shall be refused a continuance, and shall demand a jury to try his cause, the accused shall be bailed, or, in default of bail, committed to jail, and the case shall be postponed until the quarter session next thereafter to be held. The Courts held on the first Mondays in March, June, September and December shall be Courts of quarter sessions. Juries for the trial of criminal cases at said sessions shall be thus procured: The commissioners from the

list of persons liable to do jury duty shall make a list, put their names in a box, and at each quarter session draw by lot a jury of seven to serve for the next quarter session. The first such jury may be drawn at any time after the passage of this Act. They shall be summoned by the special bailiff or other constable five days before the term at which they are to serve. Whenever a presentment or indictment for a misdemeanor shall be found in the Superior Court, the same with all papers connected therewith may, in the discretion of the Judge, be immediately transmitted to the County Court, and there be tried in the manner herein prescribed. In such cases the fee of the Solicitor General shall be taxed with the other costs; that of the county solicitor shall be paid out of fines and forfeitures, or, in default of the sufficiency of such funds, from the county treasury. On <i>certiorari</i> of a criminal case to the Superior Court the Solicitor General shall represent the case. His fee for such service shall be five dollars, except in cases where the indictment or presentment was found in the Superior Court. If a demurrer to an indictment found or presentment made in the Superior Court shall be sustained in the County Court the County Court shall proceed in all respects as though the indictment or presentment had been a written accusation, such as is provided for in section 12 of the Act hereinbefore recited.

Sec. 7. That the Court at its quarter sessions further shall have jurisdiction without the intervention of a jury (unless a jury is demanded as herein provided) to try and determine common law civil causes in tort or contract wherein the principal sum claimed, value alleged, or damage laid does not exceed the sum of three hundred dollars; in such cases suit shall be brought, service perfected, trial proceed, execution issue and be enforced, and the proper officer attend the Court and obey its mandates in all respects, as in the like cases in the Superior Courts. It shall be the right of either party in a cause involving more than one hundred dollars to demand a jury; such demand, if by the plaintiff, shall be indorsed upon the writ at the time of filing the same, and the sum of six dollars be then deposited with the clerk as jury fees; on affidavit made by plaintiff that by reason of his poverty he is unable to pay the same. The like demand may be made by the defendant at the appearance term in answering the cause, and he shall be then held to the same condition as to the payment of jury fees, unless the same shall have already been deposited or affidavit made as aforesaid by the plaintiff; when

<page id="GA1873.1.P263" no="GA1873.1.266" />

such demand shall be made by either party, the Court shall draw a jury of six for the trial of such cause, and have summoned as in criminal cases. The same right of exception to jurors and no other, as in criminal cases, shall be allowed, and wanting jurors in like manner be supplied. The jury fees shall be computed as costs against the party cast. The Court, in its discretion, may require the same jury to try any number or all of the civil causes wherein a jury trial is demanded, and may apportion the burden of jury fees among the parties east in such causes: <i>Provided</i>, such costs in no case shall exceed six dollars; where such apportionment is made, the sum deposited in excess of the sum taxed in each case, shall be refunded to the depositor. A deficit in jury fees shall be supplied from the county treasury by certificate, as to jurors in the Superior Court. When no demand for a jury is made, the right of trial by jury shall be considered waived; it shall be the right of either party in any such cause to enter a motion for a new trial. The abstract of evidence and all the papers shall be perfected in the County Court under the rules that obtain in the Superior Court; the papers then shall be transmitted by the Clerk to the Superior Court, and be there entered on the motion docket for a hearing at the first term. <sidenote>Court may try civil cases without jury, when.</sidenote> <sidenote>Parties may demand jury, when.</sidenote> <sidenote>Same jury may try all civil cases.</sidenote> <sidenote>Costs.</sidenote> <sidenote>Motions for new trials.</sidenote></p><p>215.

That all regular causes brought by petition and process involving not more than one hundred dollars principal sum, shall stand for trial at the first term; causes involving a greater principal sum or value, shall stand for trial at the quarter session next after the appearance term. In all regular cases wherein at the trial term there is no issuable defense filed on oath, it shall be the right of the plaintiff to have judgment as by default. <sidenote>Trial term.</sidenote></p><p>216. Sec. IX. That when the affidavit for an attachment or garnishment, or for any other warrant other than a criminal warrant, jurisdiction to try which is given to the County Court by this Act, shall be made before one of the commissioners, the commissioner himself or the clerk, when required by the complaining party, shall issue the writ or warrant in the name of the county commissioners, making it returnable according to its dignity, as hereinafter defined, to the next regular monthly or quarterly session, unless by special law a longer time is necessery for giving notice to the adverse party, in which case the return shall be made to the next succeeding term. The writ or warrant in any such cause shall be directed to the same officer, (with the addition of the special bailiff of the County Court,) to which the like writs or warrants are now required by law to be directed, and such proceedings thereafter shall be had as now by law are prescribed. Nothing in this section shall be construed to interfere with the existing authority of any magistrate in any of the several classes of cases herein recited. <sidenote>Attachment and garnishment proceedings.</sidenote></p><p>217. Sec. X. The County Court shall discharge all the duties formerly devolved on the Justices of the Inferior Court, as to county business. They also may sit as a board of arbitrators in any case referred to them by the parties in interest that may be arbitrated under the provisions of chapters 1 and 2 of title 28 of the Code. The

<page id="GA1873.1.P264" no="GA1873.1.267" />

hearing shall be had at a regular or adjourned term of the County Court; the award when made shall be entered as the Court's judgment at the next regular monthly or quarterly session, according to the amount or value involved, and shall be enforced by execution, as in other cases. The like submission shall be made, notices be given and exceptions taken, as in cases of arbitration under the statutory provisions aforesaid. When exceptions are so filed to making an award the judgment of the County Court the matter shall go to the Superior Court as by consent appeal, and the exceptions there be heard, as is now provided by law. When any cause so arbitrated is superior to the jurisdiction of the County Court, the award after notice given, as in section 4183 of the Code, shall be returned by the Clerk to the next Superior Court, and exceptions, if any, filed and determined there, as prescribed by sections 4184 and 4185 of the Code. The costs may be taxed against either party, or both, as the arbitrators may think just and right. They shall have each one dollar per day while employed in the arbitration, and one per centum on the sum or value involved. The order of business at every term, shall be: 1st. Criminal cases, requiring a jury or jail delivery; 2d. Civil causes, requiring a jury; 3d. Other civil causes; 4th. Other criminal causes; 5th, County business; 6th. Arbitrations.

An exhibit of all receipts and disbursements shall be made by the commissioners to the grand jury of the Superior Court at every Spring term, and incorporated in their general presentments.
