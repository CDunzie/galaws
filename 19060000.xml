If the city is dissatisfied, and the appeal is entered by it, it shall give bond, with security, for the payment of the amount adjudged to be due by it on the final hearing of said case. Should no appeal be entered within ten days,

But the city of Ashburn shall have the right, after said award is filed, to abandon its purpose of widening, extending, straightening, laying out, opening or establishing said street, alley, lane, walk or square, in the event the mayor and city council should consider that the sum found to be due would, in their judgment, make said lands so sought to be condemned too expensive to said city.

A majority of the arbitrators can make the award.

The arbitrators shall be sworn to make a just and true assessment of the damages, considering the value of the land and the benefits the owner is to receive from the opening or otherwise changing said street. If the owner of such land refuses to act, or is a minor, or is insane; upon the facts being shown to the ordinary of Decatur county, he may appoint the arbitrator for such owner. The award, when so filed and not appealed from, shall be the judgment of the superior court of Decatur county, and execution may at once issue upon same for the amount thereof as other executions are issued. In case of appeal as above provided for, the court shall cause the issue as to such to be made up and tried as other appeal cases. The entering of an appeal shall in no case hinder or delay the town in widening, extending, straightening, opening, laying out or establishing such street, alley, lane, walk or square as aforesaid, but the same may proceed from the time the award in such condemnation proceeding is filed in the office of the clerk of the superior court, but before the commencement of said, tender shall be made of the amount of the award. In the event the town of Donalsonville is not dissatisfied with said award, it shall pay to the clerk of the superior court the amount so found to be due by said arbitrators. If the town is dissatisfied and the appeal is entered by it, it shall give bond with security for the amount adjudged to be due by it on the final hearing of said case. Should no appeal be entered within ten days, and the town of Donalsonville should fail or refuse to pay the amount of the award, and should proceed with the work, then the clerk shall upon the application of the owner, or ordinary where he is authorized to act, issue execution on said award, and proceedings thereon shall be the same as had in cases of judgments and executions in the superior court of Decatur county. But the town of Donalsonville shall have the right, after said award is filed, to abandon its purpose of widening, extending, straightening, laying out, opening or establishing said street, alley, lane, walk or square, in the event the mayor and town council should consider that the sum found to be due would, in their judgment, make said lands so
