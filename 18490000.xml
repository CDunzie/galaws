It is vain to deny that we, the injured party, have, for a series of years, by a vacillating and temporising policy, only assured the courage of our assailants, and invited, by an excessive sensibility, on the subject of the <i>ultimate consequences</i> of decisive action, further and still more iniquitous experiments upon our forbearance and patience.</p><p>The best defence of liberty is the first blow stricken in its defence, and for the first right violated. With all the accumulated injury of fifteen years that we have had to endure from the anti-slavery States, and that we so sensibly feel to-day, we yet do not feel more keenly, nor do we express more forcibly our sense of this outrage, than did the Legislature of Georgia twenty-two years ago upon the bare proposition of the friends of colonization to vote an appropriation for the removal of free negroes to Liberia. Yet the Joint Committee on the State of the Republic in the year 1827 declared, in reference to this subject, so harmless in the comparison with the audacity of recent legislation, that they could not help reprobating the cold-blooded [Illegible Text] or unthinking [Illegible Text] which actuates many of our fellow citizens in other States to an interference with our local concerns and domestic relations totally unwarranted either by humanity or constitutional right.</p><p>Such interference is becoming every day more determined

<page id="GA1849.1.P406" no="GA1849.1.406" />

and more alarming. It commenced with a few unthinking zealots, who formed themselves into abolition societies, was seized upon by more cunning and designing men for political purposes, and is supported by more than one of the States, as is evident from the amendments to the constitution proposed by legislative bodies, and so frequently and indeed insultingly presented for our approbation. The result of such interference, if persevered in, is awful and inevitable. The people of Georgia know and strongly feel the advantages of the Federal Union. As members of that Union, they are proud of its greatness; as children born under that Union, they will ever defend it from foes internal as well as external; but they cannot and will not, even for the preservation of the Union, permit their rights to be assailed, they will not permit their property to be rendered worthless, they will not permit their wives and children to be driven as wanderers into strange lands, they will not permit their country to be made waste and desolate by those who come among us under the cloak of a time-serving and hypocritical benevolence. How then is the evil to be remedied? Only by a firm and determined union of the people and the States of the South, declaring through their legislative bodies, in a voice which must be heard, that they are ready and willing to make any sacrifice rather than submit longer to such ruinous interference, and warning their enemies that they are unwittingly preparing a mine, which once exploded will lay our much beloved country in one common ruin. Such language as this the patriotic guardians of our State thought the crisis of 1827 justified. Who now, with the lights of 1849 before him, and the enormities of Northern aggression since the days of this remonstrance, but feels that either the grievances of twenty years ago were vastly exagerated, or we have suffered that quick resentment and sensibility to wrong to fall into decay, and our minds to become patient and calm under [Illegible Text] which would have been intolerable to the high spirits of that day. But it may be urged in defence of the long suffering of the South, that her attachment to this Union has been akin to a sacred devotedness, that from no [Illegible Text] spirit of profit or of [Illegible Text] have we clung to it with such tenacity that a quarter of a century of [Illegible Text] upon our rights and of paltering with our capability of endurance, has barely been enough to induce us to count the value of it. With the whole South this Union has been regarded as dear to us from a higher, a nobler appreciation than because it promoted the general welfare. It has been dear to us because purchased with the blood of our fathers, because transmitted to us with their benedictions, and because we had hoped under its sway to see human liberty and human progress advanced to that point that should give the name of American freedom as a

<page id="GA1849.1.P407" no="GA1849.1.407" />

guaranty for any future experiments in self-government. Though often charged with a reckless and restless spirit, which was not submissive to constitutional restraints, the South boldly meets this charge by asking when did we ever cause collision between members of this Union by any aggressive legislation, by a distrustful, a self-seeking or a domineering policy? When did the South, by stretching the powers of the government, excite alarm or jealousy? When did she insult the self-respect of any member of this confederacy by contemptuous comparisons or by a pragmatical and patronising interference with the internal policy and interest of any State? Or when did her pulpit lend itself to fan the flame of civil discord, or when in our borders was the temple of the living God made the theatre of display for the [Illegible Text] hate of brother against his brother? Let these reproaches fall where they are deserved. The South has no dread of them. From the earliest date of the slavery controversy, the South has [Illegible Text] a yielding and conciliatory spirit, for it will be hard indeed for any one to show the slightest mutuality in the concession made on the part of the South of all representation of two-fifths of her slave population. Can any fair reason be urged why the South should not have entered into this Confederacy claiming a full representation for this species of property? If taxation implies a correlative right of representation, then was the Southern slaveholder unjustly treated, when it was demanded of him that before he could enter this Union as a citizen he must first surrender the right of having two-fifths of his slaves represented, when that two-fifths were as certainly taxed on all articles of their consumption as were their masters. But yet the South yielded this point. She consented also to abolish the foreign slave trade, by which she might have cheaply supplied herself with slave labor; and when the northernmost slave States thought fit to abolish the institution in their borders, she interposed no obstacles or vexatious hindrances, though it might have been clearly foreseen that this result would have been fruitful of trouble to those States that would find their necessities or their convenience demanding a continuation of the system. In every interference with the question of domestic slavery by the North, she has failed and failed signally to justify her course by any reason of a purely political character and much less by such political reasons as are to be found in or tolerated by our Constitution. There could be no other complaint reasonably urged by the North against the existence or the extension of [Illegible Text] slave property of the South, but that the federal representation claimed for it was unequal and therefore unjust towards the North; but as we have seen the only inequality in this thing is against the South, and not in her favor, it then resolves itself into this, that this government so restricted in

<page id="GA1849.1.P408" no="GA1849.1.408" />

the exercise of all power, is to be allowed to turn propogandist, and devote its best energies to the driving through, against all resistance of plighted faith, of constitutional law, against all claims of right, justice or fraternity, a moral reform that has first and last for its object a [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] from our midst of what is denounced as a gross immorality, and a determination to give practical effect to the idea that this government as a government [Illegible Text] the sin of slavery. It is the first and last instance furnished by our history in which this government has thought it rightful or expedient to subsidize religious agencies by the strong [Illegible Text] of political power. It would require but one short step further in this attempt to regulate a matter of conscience, to see our duty clearly dictating a union of Church and State. We feel it to be unnecessary to trace this controversy step by step to its present critical if not perilous stage. If we should do so with the minutest fidelity, its history would at every turn only show how reluctant the South has been to [Illegible Text] the grave matters in issue to that extremity which would leave the true friends of harmony and union nothing to hope. It has been [Illegible Text] fault that we in every instance invited imposition by indicating a yielding disposition which only required to be hard pressed to grant the most extravagant requisitions. So it was in the controversy with the antislavery States which gave birth to the Missouri Compromise. In this misnamed surrender of Southern rights, who can show a particle of consideration passing to the South? Where, in this one-sided Compromise, is there to be found the least reciprocity? Yet we gave in to this unreasonable and unjust requirement, and avowed a love for this Union which would not suffer us to part with it, though the North was [Illegible Text] to make us pay in valuable and unrighteous concessions for every day of its existence.</p><p>This Compromise, by which we bought our peace for more than a quarter of a century, we observed with [Illegible Text] honor; and when in the course of events it came to the turn of this portion of the Union to be benefited by the operation of that law, we find the Northern States unblushingly [Illegible Text] their own contract, and when called upon to reaffirm their own long expressed [Illegible Text] of this Compromise, they refused to do so, and as evidence of their [Illegible Text] purpose to evade their plighted faith, they sought to organize a territory embraced in the spirit of this Compromise, (by which every thing had been for years secured to them,) upon the anti-slavery basis, in the unmitigated and [Illegible Text] shape of the Wilmot proviso. The North now [Illegible Text] the Missouri Compromise, because of the inevitable [Illegible Text] involved in that law, that if north of 36 30 slavery is prohibited, south of that line it may exist. Passing over the insincerity now so transparent, with which the

<page id="GA1849.1.P409" no="GA1849.1.409" />

anti-slavery States opposed to the 21st Rule of the House of Representatives, their specious attacks against that wholesome and conservative check upon fanaticism under the guise of a zeal for the right of petition, we come to the more recent legislation of Congress on the subject of slavery. And now can any Southern man at all conversant with the history of the abolition movement from its inception longer doubt that the first aim of that agitation was a total and final emancipation of our slave property? Why should we [Illegible Text] it? Because of the bad faith involved, was ever treachery and selfishness so blended before in the public conduct of any civilized [Illegible Text] as is involved in the course the North has pursued in regard to this Compromise we have just spoken of? Because of the daring violation of private rights or constitutional provisions and guarantees, can the [Illegible Text] of man go further than several of the Northern States have gone in their practical [Illegible Text] of the laws securing to the South the privilege of reclaiming her refugee slaves; or can any [Illegible Text] improve upon the savage proposition of the last Congress to permit the slaves of the District of Columbia to vote themselves the equals [Illegible Text] their masters? This brings our enemies in one step of the goal they have kept their eyes steadily fixed upon for twenty years, and has brought us too in one step [Illegible Text] the last dishonor that can be reserved for us. They have but to lay their hands on slavery in the States, and we make one more [Illegible Text] and feeble remonstrance, and the great work is finished. In view therefore of the past history of this war upon the peace, the rights, and the safety of the Southin view of its present aspects, and in anticipation of its future progress, we [Illegible Text] to the House for its action the following preamble and resolutions, accompanied by a bill providing for the call of a Convention of the sovereign people of this State.</p><p>Whereas the people of the [Illegible Text] States have commenced and are persisting in a system of [Illegible Text] upon the Constitution and the rights of a portion of the people of this confederacy, which is alike unjust and dangerous to the peace and perpetuity of our cherished union: be it</p><p><list><item><p>1st. <i>Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of Georgia in General Assembly [Illegible Text],</i> That the Government of the United States is one of limited powers, and cannot rightfully exercise any authority not conferred by the Constitution.</p></item><item><p>2d. <i>Resolved,</i> That the Constitution grants no power to Congress to prohibit the introduction of slavery into any territory belonging to the United States.</p></item><item><p>3d. <i>Resolved,</i> That the several States of the Union [Illegible Text] to the confederacy upon terms of perfect equality; and that the rights, privileges, and immunities secured by the Constitution belong alike to the people of each State.</p></item>

Towns, praying an investigation into the rights of certain persons to grants for certain lots of land therein specified, reports that they have had the same under consideration, and beg leave to report:</p><p>That this is an application by G. W. Towns, asking of the Legislature an expression of its opinion as to whom grants shall issue in the existing [Illegible Text] of claims between himself and other persons to fractional lot No. 267 and lots of land Nos. 263 and 264 in the first district of originally Muscogee now Macon county.</p><p>The Committee on examination find that these three lots of land were purchased by the memorialist at public sale, ordered in pursuance of an act of the last General Assembly entitled an act to [Illegible Text] the Governor to appoint fit and proper persons to sell and dispose of the undrawn lots in the land lotteries heretofore had in this State, and to limit the time for fraction purchasers to pay for and to take out grants for fractions.</p><p>There is no controvery as to the regularity of the sale. The difficulty as to who is the proper owner of fractional lot No. 267, has arisen from the fact that there have been two several surveys of the district in which it is situated. Under the first survey, the land in this district was disposed of by lottery, and James Scott of Swain's district, Emanuel county, became the fortunate drawer of lot of land No. 267, for which a grant issued by the State on the first of October, 1827. The present [Illegible Text], John Usry, has a regular chain of title from the drawer to whom it was granted down to himself: said grant having been issued before the re-survey of said district, and the same located upon lot No. 267 of the first survey, which said lot, No. 267 of the first survey, has been long in the possession of said Scott and those claiming under him.</p><p>It having become apparent that great errors had been committed in the first survey of the district in question, the Legislature of the State ordered a new and perfect survey of the same, in the meantime making provision for protecting the rights of those fortunate drawers who might have

<page id="GA1849.1.P412" no="GA1849.1.412" />

located their grants under the first survey upon lands the boundaries of which might not be the same as those of the like numbers under the new survey</p><p>Your Committee deem any further reference to these legislative provisions [Illegible Text] and not demanded by the question in issue, as in their judgment the rights of these parties are in no wise affected by them. We have given the original plats of both the first and [Illegible Text] surveys of said district, now of file in the Surveyor General's office, a careful [Illegible Text], and by comparing the plat and grant issued to Scott, the drawer under whom Usry claims, with each of the surveys, the Committee have fully and satisfactorily arrived at the conclusion that whatever contest may hereafter arise between the memorialist and other parties in [Illegible Text] of the variations between the two surveys, that none [Illegible Text] exist between him and Usry, as it is evident that lot No. 267, granted to James Scott under the first survey, is not the same territory bought by G. W. Towns as fractional lot No. 267 in said district. And the Committee are therefore of opinion that the said George W. Towns is entitled to a grant for said fractional lot under terms of the sale at which he purchased it.</p><p>The [Illegible Text] between the memorialist and the estate of James A. [Illegible Text] in relation to lots of land Nos. 263 and 264 in the same district, [Illegible Text] upon different grounds. There is no dispute [Illegible Text] to the regularity of the sale or the identity of the lots. These, like No. 267 of the new survey, had been reported to the Governor as undrawn lots, as we are informed by the late Surveyor General, and they were all included together in the same advertisement of sale under the executive order pursuant to the act of the last Legislature.</p><p>No notice was given at the sale by the representative of Everett of any supposed claim to said two lots, and they were knocked off to the memorialist, he being the highest bidder for the same.</p><p>Not until after the sale was it communicated to the executor of Everett by one of the State House officers, and from [Illegible Text] this information is obtained, that the receipt books of fraction [Illegible Text] in the Treasury department, contained evidence that Everett had paid three instalments upon a supposed purchase of these two with several other lots, there being no return or [Illegible Text] in said office of the sale, or evidence of the first payment having been made. These entries of money paid into the Treasury by Everett on account of these two lots gave rise to the presumption that he had bought the [Illegible Text] at a former sale of undrawn lots made by the Sheriff of Macon county under legislative authority, [Illegible Text] hence the claim now interposed.</p><p>Our investigations have satisfied us that the Sheriff of Macon, who sold these lots, made no return of the sale to the

<page id="GA1849.1.P413" no="GA1849.1.413" />

proper department in Milledgeville, having, as we learn upon reliable authority, [Illegible Text] soon after the sale.</p><p>This committee offer no opinion as to the sufficiency of the evidence afforded by the entries in the fraction sales receipt book that Everett did become the purchaser of these lots at the sale made by the Sheriff of Macon county, nor do we feel called upon to say what amount of money, if any, should be refunded to Everett's estate on account of the payments made by him as noted on the receipt book of fraction sales. Our attention is only called to the question of the right to the grants of said two lots of land.</p><p>The Legislature has at various sessions made provision for the relief and protection of purchasers of the undrawn lots of the State, and at its session in 1847 an act was passed providing, among other things, that in all cases where purchasers of fractions should not take out grants for the same by the first day of November, 1848, the same should revert to the State.</p><p>Neither Everett in his life time, nor his executor since his death, have availed themselves of the benefit of either this act or an act assented to 21st of December, 1843, declaring that all lots of land not granted by the first of October, 1844, should be forfeited to the State, but said two lots, Nos. 263 and 264, remained ungranted up to the day of sale in February last, when the memorialist became the purchaser; and therefore the rights to the grants had lapsed to the State, even if sufficient proof was adduced of the purchase and the payment of the purchase money by Everett.</p><p>Your Committee are therefore of opinion that George W. Towns, as the purchaser at the sale in February last, without any notice of a prior sale of, or supposed claim to, said lots, is entitled to grants for the said two lots of land Nos. 263 and 264, in the first district of originally Muscogee now Macon county, under the terms and conditions of said sale; and they recommend the adoption of the following resolution, to wit:</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That it is the sense of the present General Assembly of Georgia that George W.
