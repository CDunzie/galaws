The obstructions in the Savannah river, below the city and within the flow of the tide from the ocean, constitute a proper subject for the action of the General Government, and require its effective aid in their removal. Having originally been caused by the British, in repelling the advance of the French fleet, then in alliance with us, when the former had possession of the city, and by our own people, against the invaders of our soil, they have remained since the days of the Revolution, impeding the navigation of that part of the river, and rendering access to the city difficult, and by vessels of heavy tonnage, impracticable. Vessels of the latter class are now compelled, from the difficulty in passing over or avoiding the accumulations of sand and mud, to receive and discharge a large portion of their cargoes at a point several miles below the city, by the use of lighters. Hence the expenses attending this branch of business are multiplied, delay ensues, and detriment to the commerce of the city necessarily follows.</p><p>The welfare of the entire State is promoted by protection to its ports. The people of our State are deeply interested in having their principal seaport open to the commerce of the world. The attention of the Federal Government has heretofore been directed to this subject, and its officers have been engaged in surveys, and devising plans for obviating the obstructions in question.
