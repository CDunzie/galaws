<page id="GA1908.1.P1036" no="GA1908.1.1049" />

<p><b>Message From the Governor.</b></p><pre>EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,<br set="RIGHT">ATLANTA, August 25, 1908.<br set="RIGHT" /></br></pre><p><i>To the General Assembly of the State of Georgia:</i></p><p>You have been called to meet in extraordinary session for the purpose of considering the disposition to be made of those convicted of crime, together with questions which are incident to the solution of this problem.</p><p>There were other matters of legislation undisposed of and pending before your bodies when they adjourned which were of great importance, but this one question involves so much to the State that I have deemed it best to include no other in the work of the present session.</p><p>While no maudlin sentiment should interpose between the criminal and the punishment for crime, I believe that we will all agree that the leasing out of convicts in Georgia should cease.</p><p>The problem of handling five thousand convicts is serious and full of difficulties. They should be punished and yet they should not be treated brutally. An effort should be made to encourage reformations among them. I concede that there is little hope of reformation as to many of the convicts, but there must be some who can be improved by proper effort during their confinement. While a mercenary motive should in no sense be the purpose of handling convicts, still if they can be made self-supporting and be so handled as to bring some benefits to the State without violating the obligations of the State, such a result is certainly to be desired.</p><p>My own opinion is that the convicts of Georgia, five thousand in number, could be used in a way by which

<page id="GA1908.1.P1037" no="GA1908.1.1050" />

humane treatment might be assured, opportunity for reformation afforded, and yet contribute greatly to the progress and prosperity of the people of the entire State.</p><p>There are railroads to be built, public highways to be constructed, dirt roads to be graded and improved, swamp lands to be drained, and many other internal improvements upon which they could be used which would increase the opportunity for progress and prosperity all over Georgia.</p><p>Foremost among the opportunities presented is the extension of the Western  Atlantic railroad to the ocean.</p><p>The Western  Atlantic in its present form is a great property, but it will be in danger at the completion of the lease to the Nashville, Chattanooga  St. Louis Railroad Company unless the scheme of its originators is executed, and it is extended to deep water at one or more of our ports.</p><p>I have no doubt that a line built from the present terminus of the Western  Atlantic railroad to one or more ports in our State could be leased for a sum which would pay interest on the cost of construction, and also interest on several millions of dollars in excess of the cost.</p><p>The extension will protect our present property, yield a handsome net profit to the State, and largely contribute to the permanent commercial independence of our people by the control of interstate freight rates.</p><p>I present these views because the time must come when they will be executed and because no disposition of convicts should be made which will prevent their use in this great enterprise when the State is ready to undertake it.</p><p>For the present I suggest a plan of handling the convicts which, while promising less, is simpler and easier, but out of which I hope eventually to see grow the larger uses which I have mentioned.</p><p>First. Submit a Constitutional amendment to the

<page id="GA1908.1.P1038" no="GA1908.1.1051" />

people which will name the time beyond which the leasing of convicts in Georgia shall cease. This amendment should be advertised on Wednesday, September 2nd, so no time can be lost in its passage.</p><p>Second. Pass a bill to raise additional revenue for your penitentiary system.</p><p>Third. Encourage each county to work its misdemeanor and felony convicts upon the public roads and upon other public improvements in the county. I have heard from the ordinaries of many of the counties of the State, and their letters indicate a general disposition by the counties to use the convicts along the line I have suggested.</p><p>Fourth. Where the quota of convicts, misdemeanors and felonies, going to a particular county is too small in number to justify their economic use by the county to receive them, permit any two or more counties to join together consolidating their convicts and allow them to work part of the time in each county, the amount of work in each county to be apportioned according to the number of convicts each county has in the combined force. This plan of exchanging convicts should be enlarged as far as possible.</p><p>Fifth. The State would retain charge of the balance of the convicts. The State should have two or more farms as a basis of operation. It might buy one or more iron or coal mines.</p><p>Those convicts whose dangerous character might render it advisable that they be not worked upon the public roads should be retained by the State and worked on the farms or in the mines. Upon the farms the State should raise all that the convicts needed to eat. The convicts upon them should make clothes, shoes, wagons and all classes of supplies needed by the State for the convicts and their use.</p><p>I have carefully examined the experiment of working convicts upon farms which has been made in a number of Southern States. Indeed, it can scarcely longer be

<page id="GA1908.1.P1039" no="GA1908.1.1052" />

called an experiment. It has been fully demonstrated that this class of work for negro convicts can be made profitable to the State, and yet furnish an opportunity for performing the State's duty to the convict to the fullest extent.</p><p>The State should organize road working forces with suitable machinery, and from time to time build roads in those counties where the counties received no convicts. The county authorities should name the roads to be built and also bear the expenses of the convicts while working roads in their respective counties. Any profits made from the use of the convicts upon farms or mines should be used towards paying expenses of working the convicts in the counties not receiving convicts. Any surplus of convicts which the counties did not take and which the State at any time is not working upon the roads in the counties could be worked upon the farms.</p><p>Sixth. All the money derived from this time on from the hire of convicts should be used to prepare to handle those convicts which the State must retain.</p><p>Seventh. Take some action providing at least for the investigation and report to the next legislature upon the extension of the Western  Atlantic Railroad by the use of convicts.</p><p>I wish especially to call your attention to the fact that there has never been a time in the history of the State when with such small inconvenience the convict lease system could be abandoned.</p><p>You appropriated last year to the schools of the State $332,524.75 more than was appropriated to them in 1907. You appropriated last year for 1909 to the schools of the State $582,524.75 more than was appropriated to them in 1907. The schools received in 1907 something over $200,000 from convict hire. When your appropriations were made in 1907 to the schools for this year and next year it was generally understood that the convict hire was included in the appropriations. But a careful examination

<page id="GA1908.1.P1040" no="GA1908.1.1053" />

of the Act disclosed the fact that this was not true.</p><p>You can, therefore, cease giving to the public schools anything from convict hire and yet leave them all that you intended to give them when the appropriation Act was passed in the summer of 1907.</p><p>Good roads and common schools should go together. Both help to develop the people and enrich the State. We are making progress with our schools. We have neglected our public roads.</p><p>I have presented the foregoing plan of handling the convicts as perhaps the best which we can adopt at the present time. I present it with no claim of originality, but in the effort to help bring together and harmonize what seems to have been conflicting views of your different members and bodies. I do not claim that the plan is ideal.</p><p>I believe it would be better for all the convicts to be worked by the State upon farms, in mines, upon public roads, and in the construction of public highways, and in the drainage and development of land now not capable of use.</p><p>I hope the time will come when from whatever system you adopt there will develop the exclusive utilization of the convicts by the State, and that they will be used to complete and perfect public highways and other internal improvements, using the farms as a basis of operation.</p><p>At the head of your penitentiary system there must be ability, honesty and enthusiasm. Those in charge on salaries should be required to give their entire time to the work. Those acting as supervisors should give their entire time to it. Those handling farms should be called to no divided allegiance and should not be subjected to the development of selfish action by seeing their own property calling for their attention in the neighborhood of the State's property.</p>

<page id="GA1908.1.P1041" no="GA1908.1.1054" />

<p>There must be the earnest desire to help the people of Georgia by aiding the counties with information and inspiration, that they may handle their convicts humanely yet economically; that they may perform the duty of the State to those convicted of crime, and yet bring returns to the citizens by improving in the most practical and economical manner the roads and public enterprises of the county.</p><p>The study of good roads is attracting the attention of the country. A great amount of information as to how they should be built can be furnished, and intelligent suggestion should be made from the State's penitentiary officers to the officers of the localities charged with handling convicts.</p><p>The whole system should receive supervision by the State, uninfluenced by politics or by selfishness, and inspired by real patriotism.</p><p>I commend to your favorable consideration the parole system as part of our plan for handling convicts. With ample farm facilities connected with the general plan of handling the problem, the convict might well, during the last of his confinement, be permitted to work in citizens' clothes for a while before going back among the public. To discharge from chains and stripes a dangerous convict, with no progressive step taken by which his reformation is sought, can not be contemplated without almost a shudder of alarm when we see the danger of such a course.</p><p>The reformatory for the young should be greatly improved. I believe care and thought directed toward it from those at the head of your system will be productive of valuable results.</p><p>I will not dwell upon the misdemeanor convicts as a separate class. It is scarcely necessary for me to say that the leasing of misdemeanor convicts to individuals with no State supervision should not be tolerated, and I incline to the opinion that individuals and corporations in Georgia handling misdemeanor convicts are in many

<page id="GA1908.1.P1042" no="GA1908.1.1055" />

instances subject to prosecution and suits for false imprisonment.</p><p>I know that we are all agreed upon the separation of the races and that you will make ample provision in whatever legislation you pass covering this question and providing for the care upon the State Farm of female convicts, whether convicted of misdemeanors or felonies.</p><p>Any information which I have received from other States or from the county officers is at your disposal.</p><pre>HOKE SMITH, GOVERNOR.<br set="RIGHT" /></pre></div>

If any lessee is violating or has violated his contract or any rule or regulation promulgated for the working of the convicts, and if such violation would authorize the forfeiture of the contract, and the collection of the damages provided by law.</p><p>4.

The Investigating Committee is hereby authorized to investigate any and all charges emanating from any source, and investigate any and all conditions whether in the Prison Commission or convict camps, and particularly to find whether or not any of the irregularities charged as existing were within the consent or knowledge of the Prison Commission.</p><p>Resolved further, That for the purposes of this investigation, the Committee shall have full power and authority to call before it all witnesses which it deems necessary, and a subpoena signed by the chairman shall be sufficient authority to force the attendance of any witness desired. The Committee shall also have power to require the production of any and all books, papers, documents, or other writings which, in the judgment of the Committee, are necessary for the purposes of the investigation. The Prison Commission is authorized and directed to have present when requested by the Committee any convict desired to be used as a witness, whether such convict be in the custody of the State, any lessee, or any county. The Committee is further authorized to do any and all things necessary for the carrying out of its duties and making the investigations required by this Resolution.</p><p>Resolved further, That the Committee shall have the power and authority to employ and appoint a stenographer to take down and report its proceedings, and shall also have the power and authority to name and appoint some fit and proper person or persons to attend its proceedings and act in serving its subpoenas and warrants, and to otherwise assist the Committee in performing its duties.</p><p>Pursuant to the specific directions therein given, and in the order named, we report as follows:</p><div><title>I.<br set="CENTER" /></title><p><blockquote><p>1. If any officer, chief warden, warden, guard or

<page id="GA1908.1.P1049" no="GA1908.1.1064" />

other employee of the State, whose duty it is or was to manage, control, or who is or was otherwise connected with the convicts of the State, is receiving or has received any emoluments, money, compensation, gift or gratuity from the working, trafficiking in or controlling of convicts, other than the lawful compensation allowed by the State, and this investigation and report shall cover any such officer, chief warden, warden, guard, or other employee whether now in the employment of the State or not.</p></blockquote></p><p>We find and report that Mr. J. C. Moore was appointed an employee of the Prison Commission in 1898, with the title of State Warden, and discharged the duties of such up to January 1, last.</p><p>We find, from Mr. Moore's admissions under oath, that while acting as State Warden, and while being paid by the State as such, he negotiated a number of deals between convict labor lessees for the transfer of lease contracts, receiving compensation therefor from one or the other of the parties, and in some instances possibly from both. As stated by Mr. Moore, the fees or compensation received by him for negotiating these deals, aggregated about $2,700.00.</p><p>Whether these transactions, admitted by Mr. Moore, are all in which he had a pecuniary interest, the undersigned are unable to report. After diligent inquiry, the Committee has not had evidence of other deals of this character, but finds that for years past there have been very general rumors and definite impressions in several directions that the State Warden was using and had used his official position for the purpose of private gain. Mr. Moore contends, as to the admitted transactions, that there was nothing improper, immoral or illegal in his conduct, and further contends that the State did not lose anything thereby.</p><p>We are utterly unable to conceive how a high-minded State official could close his eyes to the impropriety and reprehensibility of such conduct. Such transfers meant

<page id="GA1908.1.P1050" no="GA1908.1.1065" />

frequently the discontinuance of established camps, the establishment of new camps, the substitution of new lessees, the removal or transfer of deputy wardens, and like considerations of policy and interest to the State, and upon which the Commission had a right to expect the disinterested opinion and advice of its chief officer before it approved such transfers. It needs only a statement of these facts to prove that when he negotiated these transfers for a money consideration, the State Warden placed himself in a position where he was no longer qualified to disinterestedly advise his superiors.</p><p>We further find that such conduct on the part of its chief inspecting officer was brought to the official notice of the Prison Commission and the Governor last November, by the Chairmen of the Penitentiary Committees of the Senate and House. The Governor also communicated this information to the Commission. Subsequently, Mr. Moore was permitted, by the Commission, to resign his office January 1st, following.</p><p>The Acts of 1897 and 1903, created no such office as State Warden, but authorized the appointment by the Prison Commission of wardens, and fixed the maximum salary for each at $100.00 per month.</p><p>We find that for several years past Mr. Moore has received a salary fo $100 per month as State Warden, and an additional salary of $40.00 per month as inspector of misdemeanor camps. We further find that this salary was paid by Executive warrants commencing under Governor Atkinson's administration. In our opinion this additional salary of $40.00 per month was improper, illegal, and without authority of law. The contention is that by the payment of this additional salary to Mr. Moore, the State was saved the expense of another officer as inspector of misdemeanor convicts.</p><p>While in point of fact this may be true, we hold that the Act of 1897 clearly intended what it said, that $100.00 per month was to be the maximum sum paid a warden;

<page id="GA1908.1.P1051" no="GA1908.1.1066" />

his dutes to be assigned by the Commission. If the duties of State Warden were not heavy enough to demand his full time, he should have been paid less than the maximum, or he should have been assigned duties in connection with misdemeanor inspections to occupy his time, without additional compensation.</p><p>It should further be remembered that the duty of inspecting misdemeanor camps, was, by the Act of 1897, placed on the members of the Prison Commission, and only in emergencies is it authorized to delegate this duty.</p><p>Although occupying a very responsible position, and as the evidence shows, largely relied upon by the Commission, Mr. Moore never took any oath of office, never gave bond for the faithful discharge of the duties of his office. While it is true there is in the Act of 1897 no requirement for the administering of oaths of office or requirements of bonds as to wardens, yet it is also true that the office of State Warden was established by the Commission, and some such requirement might have been made by it.</p><p>We suggest that future legislation in reference to the administration of the State Prison Department should make provision for requiring oaths of office and official bonds from important officials of this department.</p><p>We further find from the evidence, that for a considerable period while in the employ of the State as the chief inspecting officer of the prison department, with duties almost exclusively relating to seeing that lessees complied with the law, and the rules and regulations of the Commission and the terms of their contracts on pain of penalties and forfeitures, Mr. Moore was engaged in private business as a partner with W. B. Hamby, the largest lessee of convict labor under the prison department, and that this fact was known to the Prison Commission. We further find from the evidence that for some time past, and when he resigned, Mr. Moore was largely in debt to Dr. Hamby, and interested as joint

<page id="GA1908.1.P1052" no="GA1908.1.1067" />

owner with him in several landed properties. The eyidence shows clearly that the members of the Prison Commission depended very largely upon and followed Mr. Moore's advice, in many matters which directly affected Dr. Hamby's interests.</p><p>Such intimate business relations between this chief inspector of the prison department and the chief lessee of convict labor under the prison department, in the opinion of the undersigned were highly improper and justly the subject of severe criticism.</p><p>The statements of the Prison Commission admit their knowledge of the existence of the business partnership between the chief inspector and the chief lessee, and we declare it to be our conviction, that the Commission, with its first knowledge of such relations, should have ordered the partnership and further similar dealings at once discontinued, or discharged the employee who had no higher sense of official propriety than to establish and continue private business relations which were bound to bring the department and its officials under criticism and suspicion.</p><p>We further find and report that for different periods, in some instances extending over years, and coincident with the very existence of the system, practically all of the deputy wardens of the department, while in the employ of the State and paid as such, received salaries or compensation from the lessees, in one or more instances nearly twice as much as paid by the State. The evidence filed by the Committee shows the names of these wardens and the lessees paying, as also the names of the few wardens who have not received such compensation.</p><p>These facts, we find, were brought to the official notice of the Commission, at the same time and in the same manner as were the facts in reference to the State Warden, and the evidence is that in March last the Commission issued an order forbidding the continuance of

<page id="GA1908.1.P1053" no="GA1908.1.1068" />

this practice. The evidence before the Committee shows that no further inquiries have been made by the Commission since the issuance of the order. It is in evidence before the Committee that deputy wardens W. S. Tyson and Ed. Cox, and lessees, the Cherokee Brick Company and H. Stevens  Sons Company have not obeyed this order and discontinued the practice.</p><p>We recommend that the Commission discharge these two deputy wardens, and also advise that the penalties provided by law for such flagrant disregard of the Commission's orders be enforced against the lessees.</p><p>The undersigned were amazed at the indifference as to proper official conduct with which deputy wardens and lessees have looked upon this practice, and indeed it seems to have become a custom acquiesced in by all and sanctioned by the former State Warden, who had knowledge of it, and in at least one instance advised it.</p><p>We find also, that in several instances, as will be noted in the evidence, physicians and guards received compensation or perquisites from lessees, in one instance the Secretary of the Commission, in informing a camp physician of a reduction in his salary, advising that he look to the lessee for the amount of the reduction, which he did.</p><p>There is no excuse which can palliate such conduct in State officials. These deputy wardens occupied positions of the highest responsibility and trust. Their duty was to the State and to the State alone. They were entrusted with the care of the State's convicts, whose labor alone had been hired to the lessee. The law and the rules of the Commission required them to see that the reasonable labor sold to the lessees was delivered; they were required to see that the convicts were worked humanely, under sanitary conditions and healthful surroundings, within fixed hours, and were fed, clothed, housed and cared for in health and in sickness, according to specific rules laid down in the law and by

<page id="GA1908.1.P1054" no="GA1908.1.1069" />

the Commission acting under the law. By this same law and under these rules, and under their contracts and bonds, the lessees owed the State solemn duties, for the failure to perform which heavy penalties and forfeitures were prescribed by the law and nominated in the bonds. The wardens stood as the watchmen of the State and the guardians of its convicted criminals. For these trusted State officers to become also the employees of the lessees, and to receive from them compensation frequently as large as that paid by the State and ofttimes from twenty-five to one hundred and fifty per cent. larger, was to place themselves under such obligations as would interfere with, if not render impossible, honest discharge of their duties to the State or its wards. No mere man can serve two masters with conflicting interests. This is the truth of God, as well as human experience. The evidence before us conclusively proves that deputy wardens are not exceptions, and many of the violations of rules and abuses of convicts, clearly established by the evidence, are due to the existence and universal practice of this pernicious custom. It is no extenuation to contend that the State paid these officers only meagre salaries. We believe these salaries are too small, but the State officer who has no higher conception of official duty and propriety than to supplement insufficient salaries by the acceptance of gratuities from lessees whose interests are opposite to those of the State, and may at any time become conflicting, or involve the incurring of heavy penalties or the forfeiture of valuable contracts, and in which his conduct may be the deciding issue, puts himself where it may become impossible to earn even the meagre salary paid by the State.</p><p>It is no excuse for intelligent lessees to argue that these wardens were rendering them services for this compensation. They doubtless were, and this constitutes in itself a ground for serious criticism. These services in many cases were such as ought not to have

<page id="GA1908.1.P1055" no="GA1908.1.1070" />

been rendered, because in conflict with services owed the State, and where this might not be true they required the time of State officers which belonged to the State, and unquestionably distracted their minds and attention from the discharge of official duties in positions of great and real trust.</p><p>We feel bound to criticise intelligent lessees even more severely than we do underpaid wardens. These lessees are business men of ability, experience and character, and it seems to us that a moment's reflection would have impressed them with the grave impropriety of such practices.</p></div><div><title>II.<br set="CENTER" /></title><p><blockquote><p>2. If any member of the Prison Commission knew or had reason to believe that any chief warden, warden, guard or other employee or officer of the State was trafficking in the convicts of the State and deriving a profit from the leasing or subleasing of the same or receiving any compensation from any lessee.</p></blockquote></p><p>Each member of the Prison Commission has specifically denied under oath any knowledge, official or otherwise, of the above mentioned conditions, and we accept this as true.</p><p>We believe, however, that the Commission is subject to criticism for not having information as to the conditions and practices in its department and by its employees, which were notorious, universal, and extending through the whole period of its existence. Every lessee and warden before the Committee stated that no effort was made to conceal such practices, but that they were generally known about the camps. The State Warden knew of the custom. Every deputy warden knew that practically every other deputy warden was receiving such compensation, and the guards and employees and even some of the convicts knew of the practice. As before stated, we are convinced that many of the violations

<page id="GA1908.1.P1056" no="GA1908.1.1071" />

of rules by lessees and many of the abuses in the system, shown in the evidence, grew out of and continued because of the fact that the State officers, whose duty it was to prevent or report such infractions and abuses, were in the employ of the lessees, were themselves parties to these violations, and therefore incapable of fearlessly reporting themselves or the lessees.</p><p>That such general and wide-spread, virtual, if unintentional or unconscious bribery, could have continued for ten years and extended throughout the whole force of wardens without attracting the notice of the Prison Commission, reflects severely upon its watchfulness and attention to the great trust reposed in it. We find that as far back as March, 1904, Hon. J. M. Strickland, a candidate in that year for the office of Prison Commissioner, charged in the public press over his signature, in a controversy with one of the Commission, that both wardens and guards were receiving money from lessees and that he could substantiate the charge. Such a charge, so publicly made by a reputable citizen, in our opinion, should have been investigated. Had such investigation been made, the truth of the charge must have been discovered, particularly as all of the evidence shows that there was no effort on the part of the parties to conceal it. Had any member of the Prison Commission visited any of these felony camps, he must have seen that the deputy wardens were discharging the duties of superintendents, overseers, and other like work, as at some of these camps they were in absolute and exclusive charge of the entire business of the lessee, discharging important work not required of them as employees of the State, and in conflict with their duties as wardens. This at least would have put the Commission on inquiry as to whether or not such wardens were doing this work for pay or not.</p><p>We, therefore, feel constrained to criticise the Commission for negligence in this respect.</p><p>We further find and report, that deputy warden A. J.

<page id="GA1908.1.P1057" no="GA1908.1.1072" />

Harvard now owns an interest in the business of the Flowers Lumber Company, who are lessees of convict labor, and is presumably deriving a profit from the leasing of the convicts worked in this business, and over whom as deputy warden he is placed.</p><p>Such an interest is incompatible with a proper discharge of his duties as warden, and we recommend that the Prison Commission demand that he at once dispose absolutely of his interest in the business, or that he be discharged as a deputy warden.</p></div><div><title>III.<br set="CENTER" /></title><p><blockquote><p>3. If any lessee is violating or has violated his contract or any rule or regulation promulgated for the working of the convicts, and if such violation would authorize the forfeiture of the contract and the collection of the damages provided by law.</p></blockquote></p><p>We are of the opinion that the rules, regulations, and orders of the Commission have been violated by the following lessees, and in the following particulars, towit:</p><p>In night work at the mines of the Durham Coal  Coke Company, and the Lookout Mountain Coal  Coke Company; and at the camp of the Chattahoochee Brick Company, the rules providing that the State's convicts shall be worked only from sunrise to sunset, and have specified rest hours; and also in excessive tasks imposed, and the too frequent whipping for shortage on tasks in the Durham Coal  Coke Company and the Lookout Mountain Company's mines.</p><p>The evidence also shows that the Chattahoochee Brick Company regularly employs convicts in Sunday work, and has frequently called them out before sunrise and kept them at work after sunset, and at this camp the bedding and clothes and eating quarters have been in a filthy and unsanitary condition.</p>

<page id="GA1908.1.P1058" no="GA1908.1.1073" />

<p>We also find that Cruger  Pace, at Albany, and the Flowers Brothers Lumber Company, at Blakely, have been working their convicts in violation of the rules before sunrise and after sunset; and that at the plants of the Cherokee Brick Company, and the Bibb Brick Company, and of S. M. Stanley, the sleeping quarters and eating quarters have been filthy and unsanitary and the food served during the visit of the legislative committee to these camps last fall was severely condemned.</p><p>We feel satisfied from the evidence that some of these violations by the above-mentioned companies were sufficient to work forfeitures of their contracts, and the enforcement of the penalties provided by law for violation of the rules and regulations of the Commission.</p><p>In view of the fact that deputy wardens at these camps have been receiving compensation from these lessees, and have been parties to the violations of the rules mentioned and have permitted the same to continue, we recommend that the Commission consider the matter of their discharge.</p><p>We find at many of the camps, from the monthly reports of the wardens, that the rules of the Commission prescribing the diet, particularly as to fresh meat, are not complied with, and we recommend that strict inquiry be made as to the diet, and the rules in regard thereto be enforced.</p></div><div><title>IV.<br set="CENTER" /></title><p><blockquote><p>4. If there is or has been any mismanagement or misconduct on the part of any employee, guard or other officer charged with the control and conduct of the Prison Farm in Baldwin county.</p></blockquote></p><p>We find and report an utter lack of business methods in practice at the Prison Farm near Milledgeville, and call especial attention to the report of the expert accountants, filed herewith, concerning the lack of books of records, and of any system of accounting at this institution.

<page id="GA1908.1.P1059" no="GA1908.1.1074" />

There are considerable State funds handled at this institution, and a permanent record of receipts and expenditures, with proper vouchers, should be kept. From the evidence we have been able to secure, it is impossible for us to form any conclusion or report whether all State funds received here have been properly accounted for, or whether all expenditures made have been legitimate. This is true from the beginning of the institution, and the large expenditures made in construction account down to date. The evidence shows that since its establishment only one superficial inspection of the memorandum books and records has been made by the secretary of the Commission. The evidence shows that there was no examination of the books, vouchers, records, or any criticsm of the lack thereof, by any member of the Commission.</p><p>We suggest that a proper system of bookkeeping and accounting, and a complete re-organization at this institution, be directed at once.</p><p>The evidence shows that nepotism, a curse to any government, institution or business, is in practice at the Prison Farm. The selection of the guards at the farm is left to the superintendent, and it appears that two of his young sons are from time to time acting as guards, and two of his young nephews acting in the same capacity, all of them being under age, and one son when first appointed being about eleven years of age. The superintendent's son-in-law acts as bookkeeper at the farm, and another kinsman of the superintendent holds a position as guard.</p><p>The evidence discloses that the superintendent at his will keeps horses and other stock on the farm at the expense of the State, the number of live stock at times being, by the superintendent's own testimony, as many as five.</p><p>The superintendent is allowed by the Commission a home on the farm for himself and family, but this Committee

<page id="GA1908.1.P1060" no="GA1908.1.1075" />

does not think that he should keep live stock there at the expense of the State, and they recommend that this practice by the superintendent be discontinued.</p><p>The evidence further discloses that a good many hogs and beeves are slaughtered on the farm, and the superintendent disposes of the same from time to time, but no proper record of these transactions has been kept.</p><p>The evidence further discloses that the purchases necessary for the maintenance of the farm are made by the superintendent alone and without giving a proper opportunity for the furnishing of such supplies, so as to get the lowest price for the State. Large quantities of groceries are bought, aggregating at times as much as a thousand dollars a month, without any public advertise ment for competitive bids; and it appears from the evidence that these purchases are made almost entirely from one firm in Milledgeville. The committee is of the opinion that the needs of the institution should be made known in the press, and opportunity be given for competitive bids to supply the demand.</p><p>It is further disclosed by the evidence that it has been the practice of the superintendents of the farm, by and with the consent of the Prison Commission, to allow the convicts on the farm to be worked off of the farm for private individuals by the day in agricultural work and in other work. The committee is of the opinion that this is not a wise policy; that the farm was established and the convicts placed thereon to work upon the farm alone, and the practice of working them elsewhere should be discontinued. No proper record has been kept of the funds received from this source.</p><p>The evidence further discloses that there is no effort to keep the whites and blacks separated while at work at the farm or in their eating quarters. The negroes and the whites eat in the same mess hall, though at separate tables. This, in the opinion of the committee, is

<page id="GA1908.1.P1061" no="GA1908.1.1076" />

improper, and in violation of the law. The sleeping quarters, however, of the whites and blacks are separate.</p><p>There has been evidence of cruelty in the administration of punishments at the farm. One white man, in receiving a whipping, testified that he was maimed in one of the delicate organs of his body. We have had no evidence contradicting this fact, the rebuttal evidence tending to show that the convict deserved punishment.</p><p>The evidence also shows that upon one occasion a negro convict who claimed to be sick, was forced to the field to work, over his protest, by warden Slater. When he arrived at the place to work, he was in no condition to work, as testified by the working boss, was laid in the shade, and in a few hours was a corpse.</p><p>Such inhuman neglect in ascertaining the physical condition of convicts before forcing them to hard labor, is cruelty, and should be severely censured.</p></div><div><title>V.<br set="CENTER" /></title><p><blockquote><p>5. If the Georgia State Reformatory is being conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Act creating the institution.</p></blockquote></p><p>The committee finds that the Georgia State Reformatory is not being conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Act. This Act specifically provided that the whites and blacks should be kept separate. This provision is totally disregarded. There is but one residence building upon the grounds, and the negroes and the whites both sleep and eat in this building, though in different rooms, and they also work together.</p><p>The Act further provides that the inmates shall be instructed in the elementary branches of an education. This provision is also disregarded. No teachers whatever have been furnished for instructing these youthful criminals.</p>

<page id="GA1908.1.P1062" no="GA1908.1.1077" />

<p>The law provides further that they shall be given certain manual training. This has not been done. Indeed, as has been heretofore reported by the Governor, the institution as it is now run is but a juvenile prison farm, and practically no feature of a reformatory is in practice, though the Act creating the institution provides for an up-to-date reformatory.</p><p>The Prison Commission give as their reasons for not complying with the law that they have not been furnished a sufficient amount of money for the needs of the institution, and we believe that sufficient funds have not been appropriated. They give as their reason for not having constructed separate buildings for the whites and blacks that they did not contemplate that any negroes would be sent to the institution.</p><p>The committee is of the opinion that the reformatory is a necessary institution, and that it should be properly cared for by the State, and sufficient funds appropriated for that purpose, and that buildings should be erected so as to keep the whites and blacks separated. The inmates should also be given the manual training provided by the Act and teachers should be furnished in accordance with the requirements of the law.</p><p>From the evidence submitted, the Committee is of the opinion that the superintendent and the matron, his wife, have done the best they could with the funds and the encouragement they have had. There is no reason why with proper care and a compliance with the law this institution should not be made to do great good in the reformation of youthful criminals, and to otherwise carry out the purpose and intention of the Legislature when it was created. The fact that it is located in the same county wherein the Prison Farm is located, is no reason why it can not be made a complete reformatory in the fact as well as in name, and its present location should not in any way detract from its usefulness.</p><p>The committee recommends that a sufficient appropriation be made at the present session of the General

<page id="GA1908.1.P1063" no="GA1908.1.1078" />

Assembly to construct the necessary buildings, and to purchase the requisite equipment for this institution, and to otherwise supply its needs.</p><p>The committee further recommends that the negroes now at this institution be removed to some other place at once, and that hereafter the institution be operated exclusively for whites.</p><p>We also recommend that any white inmates now in said institution, who were sent there when over sixteen years of age, be removed, and that the Prison Commission be given authority to decline to receive any person who it is satisfied is over sixteen years of age at the time of his or her commitment.</p></div><div><title>VI.<br set="CENTER" /></title><p><blockquote><p>6. If there is any mismanagement of, or cruelty to, or other violation of the law or the rules and regulations of the Prison Commission, by any of the lessees, or officers or employees of the State in any of the camps where the convicts are worked by the lessees.</p></blockquote></p><p>Charges of cruel and excessive punishment of convicts in quite a number of cases have been brought to our attention. We have investigated several of these cases. Many others have been mentioned to different members of the committee, but the committee has not had time to investigate every case, nor have we considered it necessary to do so. We have deemed it the duty of the committee to investigate such charges only as would indicate whether these cases were merely sporadic, or as liable to occur under the system, or as chargeable to the indifference of the State's officials or the lessees, to the common dictates of humanity. We believe from the evidence that charges of cruelty are well founded. We are unwilling to dismiss as unworthy of belief some of the evidence taken in regard thereto because given by exconvicts, once convicted murderers, perjurers, or discharged employees and disgruntled contractors. In some cases we have given little weight to all or parts

<page id="GA1908.1.P1064" no="GA1908.1.1079" />

of such testimony, but it should be remembered that much of this evidence is from white ex-convicts, who have been recommended for pardons by the Prison Commission, after serving very small parts of their sentences; that it has related in a majority of instances to cruelties to others, and in exaggerating which they would have no interest; that in many instances their testimony has been corroborated certainly in important particulars, and frequently in whole, and in every instance as to the fact of punishment. It should be remembered that the one case, to-wit, that of the negro convict who was sweated to death in Flower's camp at Jakin, in which the chairman of the Commission and the State Warden acted as prosecutors, was brought to their attention a year after its occurrence through the public press because of revelations made by an ex-convict. The truth is, we deem it almost impossible to secure evidence of cruelties from convicts now in prison or from officers and guards who inflict or permit such while in the employ of the State and the lessees; it is hardly natural to expect evidence from these sources. The State now has two inspectors. One of them has sworn that he has never been, nor ever expects to go into a mine in which the State's convicts are worked, to see what they are doing therein, what is required of them, or what tasks are required of them. The deputy wardens by their own testimony and admissions, rarely inspect these mines, and yet they punish, frequently and severely, on the report of an employee of the lessee that some task has not been accomplished, without actual knowledge of the severity of the task, or of the conditions under which imposed. Under these conditions, about the only source of information as to what happens in these mines or as to the condition under which the convicts are worked, must come from ex-convicts, or ex-guards, or ex-employees.</p><p>A white boy, Abe Winn, afflicted with tuberculosis, accidently or purposely, it is immaterial which, pours

<page id="GA1908.1.P1065" no="GA1908.1.1080" />

hot coffee on a deputy warden's hog. The deputy warden and owner of the hog, decides that the scalding was purposely done. He proceeds to whip the boy until he is exhausted, and is compelled to go into the hospital, from which only eight weeks later he is brought out a corpse, never having left his bed after admission. The camp physician first reported his case as pneumonia, which he testified afterwards developed into consumption, and that this was the cause of his death. This is doubtless technically true. The boy's own brother, knowing his desperate condition, accepts this as true. These can all be real facts, consumption, let it be admitted, was the cause of the death. But the shocking, horrible truth is that an angry and cruel State officer, selfishly interested in punishing, whipped to the very door of the hospital, from which he was later brought a corpse, a boy within eight weeks of a consumptive's death. The whipping under such circumstances was the cruel fact, whether it was to the death or only to the hospital door.</p><p>The negro convict at Jakin, referred to above, is disobedient, unruly, or attempts to escape, it matters not. He doubtless deserves punishment, severe punishment. Let all this be granted; an inhuman State officer decides that he will sweat him, and gives orders accordingly. The convict is sweated, wrapped head and body and feet in blankets and enclosed in a box. He dies. A camp physician certifies that his death was caused by congestion of the lungs. Doubtless it was. The report is accepted without question or investigation. One year later a convict who has finished his term, tells the truth, and though inspectors had visited that camp time and again, no whisper of the truth seems to have reached them. Upon investigation it was found that an exconvict can tell the truth, though while he is a convict he dare not open his mouth. The cruelty was in the form of punishment administered.</p>

<page id="GA1908.1.P1066" no="GA1908.1.1081" />

<p>Another negro, Peter Harris by name, claiming to be sick, is whipped and put to work, till he falls exhausted, and two hours later is dead. Some of the witnesses testify that he was whipped to death, others, including the camp physician, that his death was due to congestion from the excessive drinking of cold water while overheated. Whether the whipping caused death or not, does not mitigate the fact that a sick convict, to whom the camp physician swears he had that morning given a purgative, is later whipped, put to work at admittedly the severest and hottest task, and in a few hours is dead. This constitutes cruelty.</p><p>A white man is confined at the Durham Coal Mines under a twenty-year sentence. He refuses to work. The warden decides to administer a whipping. He has the reputation of being a very desperate character. He doubtless needed severe punishment and should have received it. The warden calls him out and orders him to strip to receive a whipping. He refuses and resists all appeals and threats. Finally he draws a razor and starts toward the warden, though shackled. The warden insists he made three efforts to reach him (the warden) and that he finally told him he would shoot if he did not submit. The warden admits he could have kept out of his reach by retreating, and virtually admits his life was not in danger, but that he decided that if he did not shoot him, his authority would be lost, and guards and convicts would no longer respect it, and guards and convicts would no longer respect it, and as he declares, he shot to kill him, aiming directly between his eyes. He hit him in the side of the neck and killed him almost instantly. Ex-guard Tatum swears that when the warden shot, the convict was standing still, had covered his eyes with his hands, and told the warden to shoot. The evidence shows that a coroner's jury investigated this homicide, and two grand juries returned No Bill.</p><p>The committee condemns this homicide. It does not believe a warden has a right to kill a convict merely to

<page id="GA1908.1.P1067" no="GA1908.1.1082" />

assert his authority or for any salutary effect such a show of authority may have on guards or convicts. He could have only been justified when necessary to protect his own life or that of his guards. He could not have been in serious danger surrounded as he was at the time of the shooting by twenty-five guards, each with loaded shotguns. Any one of them, had the man started to cross the ten or fifteen feet intervening, could have stopped him with a shot. The warden might have been excusable had he shot merely to cripple. When he deliberately killed the man under the circumstances related by him, he committed an unlawful act and should have been punished therefor.</p><p>The monthly whipping reports to the Commission, examined by the committee, show an unusually large number of whippings at the Durham Coal Mines, the Lookout Mountain Mines, and the Chattahoochee Brick Company. A large percentage of the whippings at these two mining camps are for shortage of tasks and for slate in coal. The hospital reports from the Durham Mines also show what seems to be a large-percentage of cases in the hospital resulting from accidents in the mines, from falling slate and similar causes. The evidence before us shows that in these two mines the convicts are required to mine certain quantities of coal in a day, free from some unproven percentage of slate, and that when they fail to secure these tasks or have too much slate in the coal, on complaint of the mining bosses they are whipped by the State's officers. The evidence also shows that the reasonableness of these tasks depends largely on the size of the vein, on the conditions under which the mining is carried on, on the expertness of the particular operator, on the amount of propping to be done, and the fact as to whether properly prepared and sized propping material is supplied, on the greenness of the operator, etc.</p><p>The evidence further shows that the mining boss or foreman, an employee of the lessee, fixes the task, and

<page id="GA1908.1.P1068" no="GA1908.1.1083" />

decides if it has been obtained, or if there is too much slate in it.</p><p>The evidence shows that neither inspector Deadwyler, nor inspector Burke have ever been into either of these mines. Inspector Deadwyler is seventy-three years old, too old in our opinion for the arduous duties of an inspectorhe declares that he never expects to go into a mine to see what is required of these convicts, or under what conditions it is required, and frankly admits that he does not know what is a reasonable task. Inspector Burke testified that he started into the Durham mines once and went about a hundred yards, when the water and mud were so bad it would ruin the only suit of clothes he had with him, and he abandoned the inspection. He further testified that he could not enter the Lookout mine if he wanted to.</p><p>The evidence is that occasionally a deputy warden goes into the mine, but that others have never been.</p><p>Deputy warden Ivey was formerly in charge of about fifty convicts at the Palmer Brick Yard. His evidence, and his reports show, that he would go for weeks or months without a whipping, or only one or two. Some time since he and his squad were moved to the Lookout mine, and at once he began to frequently administer to this same squad twenty-five and upwards whippings a month, a large percentage of which were for idleness or failure to get tasks.</p><p>The undersigned are satisfied from the evidence that the whippings at these two mines are excessive and too frequent. These official reports, we are satisfied from the evidence, are not always accurate, but ought to be investigated. Men, even convicts, are not going to idle or fail to get their tasks week after week, when they know a whipping is certain, if the tasks are fair, reasonable, and within their ability.</p><p>We have not found in our investigations, a single State official who has fairly investigated this task question, or the conditions under which they are required,

<page id="GA1908.1.P1069" no="GA1908.1.1084" />

and the possibilities of the cruel treatment of the convicts in regard thereto are limitless.</p><p>The evidence as to the treatment of convicts at the Chattahoochee Brick Company, the character of the food furnished at times, the filthiness of their sleeping and eating quarters and the excessive and exhaustive work exacted of them, and the punishments inflicted, have convinced us that many of the humane rules of the Commission have been violated at this camp. The evidence shows that the men are worked overtime and excessively hard, and many of them regularly on Sunday.</p><p>It is claimed that in a plant of this kind a certain amount of Sunday work is necessary, and that only volunteers are accepted for this work. We utterly reject the belief that there can be much volunteering among convicts. They can hardly be called free agents, and there can be such an anomaly as an unwilling volunteer in a convict camp. We do not deny that there may be a certain amount of Sunday work necessary about such a camp, but neither the law nor the rules of the Prison Commission recognize the putting of convicts regularly at this work. There may be emergencies, or oxen in the ditch that would justify such employment occasionally, but we believe that regular work, such as keeping fire under a brick kiln from year's end to year's end, Sundays and nights, ought not to be done by convicts. It would be better, if such work is necessary, that it be done by free laborers.</p><p>The evidence before us convinces us that deputy warden Casey has habits which unfit him to serve as deputy warden, charged with the physical and moral welfare of convicts, and we join in the recommendation of the Penitentiary Committees of the Senate and House that he be discharged.</p><p>From the evidence before us as to the cursing of a convict in the presence of the Legislative Committee which inspected the Lookout Mountain Mines camp last

<page id="GA1908.1.P1070" no="GA1908.1.1085" />

November, for trying to make a complaint to the Committee, we recommend that Warden Maxwell be discharged. In cursing a convict for any cause he violated a very proper rule of the Commission, and showed himself unfit for his position.</p><p>We further find that no member of the Prison Commission, or its Secretary, had knowledge of these acts of cruelty. When they did learn of such, we believe they had the matter investigated. Their existence depended to a large degree upon the deputy wardens in charge of the convicts. We believe that a more thorough system of inspection would have decreased the number of cruelties, and have otherwise contributed to the more humane treatment of the convicts. We recommend that some member of the Prison Commission personally visit each convict camp in the State, at least twice a year, and that the number of inspectors be increased so that these inspections may be more frequent and more thorough.</p></div><div><title>VII.<br set="CENTER" /></title><p><blockquote><p>7. If there is any mismanagement, cruelty, or violation of the law in any road camp or other camp, either misdemeanor or felony, and if any counties are illegally disposing of their misdemeanor convicts, and if misdemeanor convicts are being illegally employed or worked.</p></blockquote></p><p>The Committee has not had time to investigate thoroughly as to any of the county road camps, but has heard evidence in regard to several, and call attention to criticisms upon several, notably the Floyd, Monroe, Coweta, Jones, Bibb, Sumter and Fulton road camps.</p><p>From the evidence before us we are satisfied that cruelties in the form of corporal punishment are rare in the county road camps. The criticism to which these camps seem to be most subject is the lack of sanitary

<page id="GA1908.1.P1071" no="GA1908.1.1086" />

quarters and clean surroundings, and suitable provisions for treatment of the sick and diseased.</p><p>We are convinced that the work required is not excessive, and possibly in some counties not hard enough, particularly when they go into winter quarters, and when regular road work in some sections of the State is almost impossible during the winter months.</p><p>In the Sumter county camp and the Royster Guano Company's camp we condemn the use of picks riveted to the ankles of convicts to prevent escape. Such appliances, kept on convicts day and night, are cruel and inhuman, and should be forbidden.</p><p>We recommend that the Prison Commission at once bring to the attention of the proper county authorities the criticism made upon these road camps by the members of the visiting Legislative Committees, as shown in the evidence herewith, and direct its inspectors to see that conditions provoking these criticisms be improved.</p><p>We especially call attention to those portions of the evidence filed with this report, concerning the existence of so-called wildcat or illegal misdemeanor camps.</p><p>As a rule these camps, the conditions existing therein, and the cruel and inhuman treatment of unfortunate convicts thus illegally sold into worse than slavery, are a disgrace to a civilized people.</p><p>A deplorable feature in regard to these, next to their inhumanity, is the fact that sworn officers of the courts and county governments, are parties thereto, and profit from the blood money wrung from the cruel and illegal labor and sweat of criminals. Sworn to observe the law, and to punish violators of law, these officials themselves disregard the spirit of the law, if they do not violate its letter, and in some instances have shown an amazing degree of ingenuity in trying to clothe their illegal acts in the guise of formal compliance with the

<page id="GA1908.1.P1072" no="GA1908.1.1087" />

letter of the law, all the more reprehensible because it shows that they knew they were violating the spirit.</p><p>Some of the cruelties perpetrated in certain of these illegal camps, as shown by the evidence, are barbaric, and we recommend that the Governor be requested to send transcripts of this evidence to the judges of the counties where these cruelties are perpetrated, that the grand juries may be specially charged with the investigation thereof, as the Prison Commission has no jurisdiction over them.</p><p>We strongly recommend that at this session of the General Assembly an Act be passed making it a felony for any State, or county official to hire or lease any misdemeanor convict to any corporation or individual, or through any form of pretended establishment of a county camp attempt to legalize any such hiring to individuals or corporations. No county should be allowed to establish any chaingang except for public roads or public works purposes, directly under the direction of bona fide county officials, and under the supervision, rules and regulations of the Prison Commission.</p><p>We especially invite the attention of the Governor to an inquiry as to whether any solicitor-general, county or city court solicitor is or has been a party to or adviser of the establishment of any of these illegal camps, or has consented to, advised or participated in such illegal hiring of misdemeanor convicts to such camps, or placing misdemeanor convicts therein, and take such steps as seem advisable, and if possible to end such practices on the part of the State's law officers.</p><p><blockquote><p>8. The investigating Committee is hereby authorized to investigate any and all charges emanating from any source, and investigate any and all conditions whether in the Prison Commission or convict camps, and particularly to find whether or not any of the irregularities charged as existing were within the consent or knowledge of the Prison Commission.</p></blockquote></p>

<page id="GA1908.1.P1073" no="GA1908.1.1088" />

<p>The undersigned regret to report that in their opinion the Prison Commission has been guilty of grave neglect in the discharge of their responsible duties, and are largely and directly responsible for many of the abuses to which our attention has been drawn.</p><p>We find that they have often left important duties to subordinate officials and have not given that attention to the details of their officers which was essential to a successful administration thereof.</p><p>We find the whole department without any proper system of bookkeeping, and at the Prison Farm without any intelligent bookkeeping and accounting.</p><p>The Committee is pleased to report that the expert accountants employed by the Committee to audit the books of the Prison Commissioner's office, report that while the system of bookkeeping in use is crude, and not up to the requirements which ought to prevail, yet that they show, and proper vouchers prove, that every dollar of public moneys passing through the Commission's office since October 26th, 1900, is properly accounted for.</p><p>We have been forced to the conclusion that the Prison Commission has left entirely too much of the responsible administration of the department to the Secretary, and while in their employ, to the former State Warden, Mr. J. C. Moore.</p><p>We call attention to the fact as shown by the evidence, that Capt. Yancey is receiving three salaries, to-wit: $100.00 per month as Secretary, $30.00 per month as bookkeeper and $20.00 per month as bookkeeper for the Reformatory. The law does not authorize the employment of a Secretary, but authorizes the employment of a clerk in the Prison Commission's office, whose compensation shall not exceed $100.00 per month. A bookkeeper is doubtless necessary, but we doubt the policy of designating one employee to fill three offices, and draw more compensation than the law specifically names.</p>

<page id="GA1908.1.P1074" no="GA1908.1.1089" />

<p>Attention is also called to the fact that the Commission in paying some guards more than $25.00 per month is openly violating the law. While we think the maximum salary for a guard fixed by law is too small, we do not hesitate to say that the Commission is wrong in paying salaries in excess of those fixed by law.</p><p>Under the contracts entered into with the various lessees, the Commission reserved the right to prorate the normal increase in the convicts over the original allotments, among the different lessees. This has not been done. Dr. Hamby, as successor to Hamby  Toomer, has now 175 of the total excess of 250 over the original allotments, although he is entitled to only about 100, under the Commission's view of the law and contracts.</p><p>As there are several lessees who have not their full quota, and whose prices are higher than Dr. Hamby's, if the Commission under the law and the contracts, has the right to prorate the excess, they should have placed the proper pro rata on these higher priced contracts and not have given Dr. Hamby more than his pro rata with loss to the State. The evidence before us shows that Dr. Hamby does not work convicts at all, but hires them solely for speculative purposes, and that at the time of making his last sub-lease contract of fifty convicts, at an annual hire of $630.00, he did not have a single convict to hire, but sublet this number after talking with the Secretary and having his promise that he should have fifteen to twenty from the Prison Farm, and the remainder as the State secured them from new convictions. For these men Hamby pays the State $221.25 per annum. We find on June 1, 1908, that the Durham Coal Company were short of its full contract quota eleven men, and that its pro rata of the excess men was thirty-six, making in all about forty-seven men that the Commission, according to its construction of the law and the contracts, at an average price of $240.00 each, could have forced this lessee to take, and yet they were given to Hamby at a much lower price, and in excess of

<page id="GA1908.1.P1075" no="GA1908.1.1090" />

the number he had any right to demand or expect, to be sublet by him for $630.00 per annum. Secretary Yancey, who made disposition of these men, frankly stated to the Committee that he never thought of the dollars the State might lose, and the Chairman of the Commission stated that until developed by the evidence before the Committee, he had no idea of these excessive assignments to Dr. Hamby for speculative purposes.</p><p>We are further convinced that the Commission was guilty of grave neglect in the matter of the appointment of deputy wardens. It is no exaggeration to say that the failure of our lease system, and the abuses which have grown up under it, must be largely charged to the fact that the wardens of the State have been, with a few exceptions, in the employ of the lessees.</p><p>But the final responsibility must rest upon the Commission for their appointment. The evidence shows that the selection and appointment of deputy wardens has been very largely left to the Secretary, and that these appointments have been unduly influenced by State Warden Moore and the lessees, notably Dr. Hamby.</p><p>The Secretary testified willingly to the fact that he had the greatest confidence in Hamby's recommendation of men for these positions, even though he must have realized that Hamby's interest could not always be unselfish.</p><p>We further find that the Commission has very properly required monthly reports from the wardens, and weekly reports from the camp physicians, and had any attention been paid to such as were sent in, or any effort made to have forced full and accurate reports, many instances of neglect, abuses, and cruelties might have been detected and ended. The Commission seems to have paid little if any attention to these reports, The Secretary says he paid virtually none, preferring to rely upon the verbal reports of the inspectors. We

<page id="GA1908.1.P1076" no="GA1908.1.1091" />

have already commented upon the lack of thoroughness in these inspections. As heretofore stated, one of the two inspectors now employed is more than seventy-three years of age, and he and his colleague do not inspect the mines, in which a large percentage of the State's felony convicts are employed. We very much fear that these inspections are perfunctory and superficial, however honest the inspectors. The former State Warden or Inspector, Mr. Moore, we think was disqualified to do effective work and make impartial reports, considering the fact that the wardens were frequently virtually his appointees, that he was frequently acting as broker in negotiating transfers of convicts, discontinuing camps thereby at some point and establishing them at others, and the partner and debtor of the lessee who controls over a third of the seventeen hundred and fifty felony convicts subject to his inspection.</p><p>The absolute and exclusive management and administration of the prison system is vested by law in the Prison Commission, and as we see it there is no escape by it for final responsibility for the conditions as they exist.</p><p>Seemingly unmindful of the grave responsibilities resting alone upon it, it has delegated important duties to indifferent employees and neglected that personal attention which the State had a right to demand of them.</p><p>We do not believe that there has been on the part of any member of the Commission, or its Secretary, any financial profit, or any willful or intentional wrong-doing, but we do believe from the evidence that their sins of neglect have been great and deserving of censure.</p><pre>Respectfully submitted,<br set="RIGHT">T.

These consisted of a ledger and journal (used as a cash book, as all cheques were journalized), bank pass books, cancelled bank cheques and their respective stubs on the Lowry National Bank and Fourth National Bank of Atlanta, the Milledgeville Banking Company, the Exchange Bank and Merchants and Farmers Bank of Milledgeville. Also pay-roll vouchers, purchase invoices and other vouchers.</p><p>We noticed that the first date in the Journal and Ledger handed to us was October 26th, 1900. We then asked for the books of record from 1897,when the Commission was created,to October, 1900. Judge Turner informed us that no books were kept up to October, 1900, but that all the data would be found in a file of vouchers, etc., purporting to cover this period. Later on,August 10th,we were handed a file of vouchers apparently for the period prior to 1900, together with a book stated to be written up from these vouchers. This book was new, the writing was fresh and we found it was made up after we had commenced the investigation.</p><p>Our examination of this file showed that the vouchers covered the period of January 6, 1899 to October 6, 1900. We could find no other vouchers for a prior period, if any are extant. On exhibit A, hereto attached, is a Statement of Receipts and Disbursements for this period. It shows a net balance (Receipts over Disbursements) of $5,155.78 as to October 6, 1900. Exhibit B, embracing the period covered by the regular ledger and

journal, starts off with a net balance as at October 26, 1900, of $5,177.12, but in the time allowed us to make this examination we were unable to account for the difference of $21.34. Exhibit B contains a Statement of Receipts and Disbursements from October 26, 1900 to May 31, 1908, this last date being the end of their fiscal year. It shows a balance in bank of Receipts over Disbursements of $1,615.87, which is correct from the evidence of the books and records submitted for our examination, exception hereinafter noted.

and 1900. Inasmuch as the funds received and disbursed were public funds, we consider it a serious omission that the proper record book was not maintained. It would have been a grave one for a commercial house, but being a matter of State government record, it becomes even more serious.</p><p>From October 26, 1900, to July, 1908, the accounting system in use while simple was fairly well maintained. It is insufficient in detail, is not modern and contains no controlling account, system of check and counter-checkon the Farm and Reformatory records.</p><p>The receipts, cancelled cheques, payrolls and purchase invoices were submitted as called for. They were correct with one large error noted below and several minor ones, matters of a few cents, too trivial to detail. (This remark applies only to period October 26, 1900, to July, 1908, and solely to the Commissioner's books,not the State Farm or Reformatory).</p><p>The error referred to above was an error in a bill of J. W. English, Jr., board of guards, July, September and August, 1900, footed as $649.24, whilst the correct amount is $469.24, a difference of $180.00, which was overpaid to Mr. English. Upon calling Captain Yancey's attention to it, he collected the $180.00, also $98.70 interest, or $278.70, which was deposited in the Lowry National Bank to the credit of J. S. Turner, Chairman, on August 4, 1908.</p><p>In checking the salary list, we noticed that Captain Goodloe Yancey, clerk of the Commission, started in at a salary of $100.00, paid by warrant, shortly after which the Commission paid him $30.00 a month for keeping the books of the Commission and since the Reformatory was started he has been paid an additional $20.00 making a total of $150.00 per month.</p><p>Also in this period, the State Warden, Mr. J. C. Moore, has been collecting $140.00 a month salary, which was paid by warrant.</p>

<page id="GA1908.1.P1081" no="GA1908.1.1096" />

<p>In examining the pay-rolls we noticed that many signatures for wages of guards, etc., are in the hand-writing of others than the one who earned the wage, and as we went on in the investigation we found it quite a general practice. The following are prominent illustrations:</p><p>Fargo pay-roll, October, 1900, of 77 names W. B. Hamby signs for 22; W. H. Mobley signs for 5, can not state positively about balance of the signatures.</p><p>Chattahoochee pay-roll, October, 1900, of 24 names, all except 2 signed x in one handwriting and not witnessed.</p><p>Bartow pay-roll, October, 1900, of 29 names all signed in same handwriting.</p><p>Coal Creek pay-roll, October, 1900, J.

of this amount is attached to pay-roll, but no receipts showing who paid to.</p><p>In addition to these signatures accepted indiscriminately, we noticed very many instances wherein guards are paid more than $25 a month, which we understand to be the limit of their wage prescribed under the Prison Commission Act.

<item><p>R. H. Smith $27.50 per mo., January, 1905, only.</p></item></list></p><p>Our general comment on the records, etc., in the office of the Prison Commission, is that the business was conducted in a very lax manner, vouchers, papers, etc., not properly checked nor sufficiently scrutinized.</p></div><div><title>STATE FARM.<br set="CENTER" /></title><p>The work on the State Farm books was started about the same time as the examination of the Commissioner's books; but as we were not able to get the records until two or three days later, we were somewhat delayed in commencing this work.</p><p>On July 29th we were showed a mass of books and papers which upon sorting out and separating we listed in number as twenty-one (21). On August 1st, another lot of books and records were sent in which upon listing we numbered as forty (40), thus making sixty-one (61) in all. After separating this consolidated lot and putting aside for our examination only those which pertained to the financial record and which was finally further reduced to those covering the Coomb's administration we recorded the following books and records:</p><p>2 Day Books covering March '03 to July '08.</p><p>1 Ledger from January, 1903-July, 1908.</p><p>1 Pay-roll Book, January, 1903-July, 1908. and a few scattered duplicate deposits slips.</p><p>Also a lot of cancelled cheques on the Milledgeville Banking Company ranging from February, 1906-May, 1908. Many cheques properly in this period were missing, none of them were numbered and several not dated. This data was afterwards supplemented by our sending a representative to Milledgeville to get the bank's record of cheques drawn but this was only valuable as showing cheques (and amount of same) missing.</p></div>

<page id="GA1908.1.P1084" no="GA1908.1.1099" />

<div><title>PROGRAM OF EXAMINATION STATE FARM<br set="CENTER">RECORDS.<br set="CENTER" /></br></title><p>With this meager data we endeavored to match the cheques we had with the invoices they paid and compare them with their respective entries on day book and ledger. We examined the pay-roll records submitted, endeavored to trace the disposition of funds received from sale of products and hire of convicts as recorded on their books and constructed a Statement of Income and Disbursements.</p><p>This statement was made from the farm records as to Income and partly from farm records and Commission records as to Disbursements. It is correct according to the records from which it was drawn (See Exhibit C). In the time allowed us for this work, we were not able to make any further examination. We would liked to have had more time, particularly to investigate the funds received from hire of convicts.</p></div><div><title>COMMENT ON LACK OF RECORDS AT STATE<br set="CENTER">FARM.<br set="CENTER" /></br></title><p>The financial affairs of the State Farm were run as though it belonged to an individual and a very careless individual. There is nothing which we could check against except what amounts practically to verbal statements. There was absolutely no system about anything. It was all left to one man, Captain Coombs, who states that he knows nothing about the records. Further comment is useless. This being State property, a complete record should have been maintained, depositing all funds in the bank and all disbursements being made therefrom. Ready cash needs should be provided for by a petty cash (Imprest) system. A record should have been provided by the Commission showing number of convicts hired, to whom and price. Also number of convicts on hand, number working and number idle.</p></div>

<div><title>REFORMATORY.<br set="CENTER" /></title><p>When we first entered the office of the Prison Commission, some twenty days ago, we asked for all the records of the Prison Commission, the State Farm and the Reformatory. Although we have made repeated requests for records, vouchers, etc., of the Reformatory, kept by the Superintendent of the Reformatory, we have not succeeded in getting them, notwithstanding that assurances were made to us that they would be produced. We have not received any records, vouchers or any papers kept by the Superintendent of the Reformatory showing his Receipts and Disbursements and can not say whether there are any such in existence or not. The information upon this subject received at the office of the Prison Commission in Atlanta was unsatisfactory, the Commission seeming not to know whether any financial records were kept at the Reformatory or not. Though the Superintendent testified before your Committee that he did keep a record of his expenditures, as stated above, we have been unable to obtain the same.</p><p>Regarding the records, etc., of the Reformatory as kept in the office of the Prison Commission in Atlanta, they were pointed out, but in view of the shortness of the time allowed to us, we were not able to examine them.</p><p>As many men were employed by us as could handle the books, etc., without getting in each other's way, but as we had only twenty working days we found the time inadequate to do more than is here reported.</p><pre>Yours very truly,<br set="RIGHT">THE JOEL HUNTER COMPANY, AUDITORS,<br set="RIGHT">JOEL HUNTER,<br set="RIGHT">President.<br set="RIGHT" /></br></br></br></pre>
