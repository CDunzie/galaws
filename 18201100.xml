Two important considerations, relative to this subject, ought particularly, to arrest the immediate attention of the Legislature, the [Illegible Text] of a neighboring state in trade, and commerce, and the lively interests manifested in various parts of the United States, in the improvements of facilities of intercourse. The solicitude on this subject, which is felt in various parts of the Union at this time, is indicated in a manner not to be mistakenand ought to [Illegible Text] the State of Georgia from her lethargy, and induce her to adopt a bold and liberal policy, commensurate with her ample resources, and the public expectations. The general importance of internal navigation, is so universally admitted, that any attempts further to illustrate it, would appear [Illegible Text] were it not for the fact, that it is an object, the [Illegible Text] importance of which has been some how overlooked or hidden in the mass of other concerns, or its advantages been viewed at too remote a distance to induce present activity. Is it not remarkable that in our present advanced state of civilization and science, man is still so little inclined to profit by his reason and intelligence, but disposed always to await the mandate of necessity. Why should an improved inland navigation be any more a theory than the building of a house or a bridge? merely because we are more [Illegible Text] with the latter than the former. In Europe a canal navigation is as familiarly known to experience as a ship, a house or a [Illegible Text], and we have the means of profiting by all the experience of Europe.With the materials and inducements which no country in Europe possesses, they will soon become as familiar to us as the most common improvements, if we can only be prevailed upon to attempt them in earnest. The moment the state shall have fairly commenced a system of internal improvement, a general [Illegible Text] in its completion will be inspired, its benefits will be felt in anticipation, in the value of lands, in an increased activity and a general prosperity. Its operation will tend to perpetuate and [Illegible Text] then our general Union by an indissoluble [Illegible Text] of interest, habits and attachments; to give [Illegible Text]

<page id="GA1820.1.P119" no="GA1820.1.120" />

[Illegible Text] of the necessaries of life, whenever our country may again be visited by the calamities of war. In times of peace or war, it will give a due value to every production of land or labor whether of agriculture, minerals or forests, promote, by the certainty of reward, every well directed branch of domestic industry, the diffesion of science and morals  the happiness of the whole community, by the facility of personal and social, as well as commercial [Illegible Text]. It will give additional importance to our commerce in making it accessible to all the productions of the most [Illegible Text] parts of the state; which productions will continually increase, with the population and progress of improvement, and finally it will give a new and more clevated character to our state, in all her foreign and domestic concerns, and in a short time place her as to wealth, rank and importance, among the first in the Union.</p><p>It will likewise add (as it appears from recent surveys) to that great chain of inland communication so long contemplated by the general government, by extending the route up the St. Mary's [Illegible Text] to a proper point, thence by a short cut or canal, along the southern margin of [Illegible Text] into the Suwanna river, and thence down the said river into the Gulph of Mexico. But your committee have in view the accomplishment of other great and important objects, besides the improvement and prosperity of our own state. As a state, we should consider ourselves as a member of a grand association of states, the fundamental principle or chief motive of whose general constitution is public happiness; whose political and [Illegible Text] bonds of union, are, and ought to be strictly reciprocal, and whose vital interests are deaply involved in the happiness of each other. [Illegible Text] this [Illegible Text] position as a state, certain obligations result, to the due performance of which we are bound.</p><p>But by opening the [Illegible Text], by which commercial intercourse and trafic may be facilitated, [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] wherever practicable, constructing locks and [Illegible Text] our water courses of obstructions, we do in fact, in a very [Illegible Text] degree, cement those political and moral bond; of union, which contribute to discharge us of those obligations we have [Illegible Text] by being a member of the general confederacy.</p><p>Nothing tends so much to keep up a good understanding between [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] of different and distinct sections of a country, as that [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] is constantly preserved by [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text].</p><p>[Illegible Text]

<page id="GA1820.1.P120" no="GA1820.1.121" />

expect to profit by that universal extension of commercial [Illegible Text], which can be so easily created by Legislative aid, affording [Illegible Text] channels and inlets, for the products and commodities of different climes, causing the savage appearance of a country to wear away and assume the aspect of busy, towns and crowded cities.</p><p>The same principles and considerations which have directed the attention of your committee to Internal Navigation, operate with almost equal force in relation to the necessity of making [Illegible Text] or other permanent roads, leading to our principal commercial towns, and likewise connecting our atlantic rivers from their highest navigable points to similar positions, upon those correspondent western streams, which flow into the Mississippi or Gulph of Mexico. All classes of the community, from the driver of the carriage and six, down to the humble pedestrian, are interested in performing their respective journies, with as much facility as possible.The increasing population and internal commerce of the state, of course, occasion an increased wear of the roads, which in a variety of instances, are still farther injured by local circumstances. Whether the laws now in force, relative to the improvement of roads in this state, have tended to effect that end, time and experience have amply evinced.</p><p>Your committee will not pretend to say, that the laws already enacted, for the amelioration of ourroads, have not been strictly exented, but they are bound to say, from occular demonstration and [Illegible Text] experience, that many of the public roads in our state, are in a shameful condition. The establishment of turupike roads in many parts of this state, where from local causes, they would be materially beneficial, are circumstances, which merit great considerationTheir utility is sufficiently evinced to every individual who has had the pleasure of travelling the roads in the middle and eastern states, and the small [Illegible Text] collected for riding and driving a number of miles, with [Illegible Text] and comfort, and without danger, ought never to enter into the computation of expenses.</p><p>It now only remains for your committee to point out those preliminary measures which appear indispensably requisite to accomplish, in the most enlightened and economical manner, the various objects which have been submitted to their consideration. As an incipient step, the appointment of a civil and topographical engineer of capacity and considerable experience, is respectfully recommended. For this officer, there ought to be a liberal provision, and his duty should be to ascertain with precision, the particular route, points and situations for the best location of the proposed improvements, by furnishing drafts and plats with explicit written [Illegible Text]

<page id="GA1820.1.P121" no="GA1820.1.122" />

and explanations from actual surveys and levels, and submit the same annually to the Legislature.</p><p>With respect to the particular mode in which the resources of the state might be most advantageously applied to such objects, that must [Illegible Text] vary according to the object and [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] at the [Illegible Text] of expenditure and may be provided for by law, from time to time, under the [Illegible Text] and direction of the civil engineer. With the foregoing remarks, your committe ask leave to refer to the bill, reported [Illegible Text] the House of Representatives, [Illegible Text] the office of [Illegible Text] and Civil Engineer, as a summary developement of their views upon this interesting subject.</p><approvaldate>Approved, 12th December, 1820.</approvaldate></law><law id="R1820V1N139" initial.page="122"><p>In the House of Representatives, 28th November, 1820.</p><p>The joint [Illegible Text] appointed by both branches of the General Assembly, [Illegible Text] take into [Illegible Text] all subjects relating to literature, public education, and free schools, respectfully submit the following report, to [Illegible Text]</p><p>There has been submitted for the inspection and consideration of your committee. reports, exhibiting the present state and condition of the university of this state.

That it is the wish of the people, is uncontrovertible, when we take into view the individual exertion, exercised in the establishment of [Illegible Text] great a number of respectable schools in different parts of the state, without the smallest aid [Illegible Text] patronage from the government.
