The killing must be the result of that sudden violent impulse of passion, supposed to be irresistible; for if there should appear to have been an interval between the assault or provocation given, and the homicide, sufficient for the voice of reason and humanity to be heard, the killing shall be attributed to deliberate revenge, and punished as murder.</p><p>7. Voluntary manslaughter shall be punished by confinement, or labour, or solitude, in the Penitentiary, for a term not less than one year, nor longer than five.</p><p>8. Involuntary manslaughter, shall consist in the killing of a human being, without any intention to do so; but in the commission of an unlawful act, or a lawful act, which probably might produce such a consequence, in an unlawful manner: <i>Provided always,</i> that where such involuntary killing shall happen in the commission of an unlawful act, which in its consequences naturally tends to destroy the life of a human being, or is committed in the prosecution of a felonious or riotous intent, the offence shall be deemed and adjudged to be murder.</p><p>9. Involuntary manslaughter, in the commission of an unlawful act, shall be punished by confinement or hard

labor, or solitude, in the Penitentiary, for a term not less than six months, and not longer than three years.</p><p>10.

In all cases of voluntary or involuntary manslaughter, the court may order the commutation of the punishment in the Penitentiary, for that of confinement in the common jail of the county where the offence may have been committed, and a fine to be imposed at the discretion of the court, which fine shall be paid to the Clerk of the Inferior court for the use of the poor of the county where the conviction takes place.</p><p>12. There being no rational distinction between excusable and justifiable homicide, it shall no longer exist. Justifiable homicide is the killing of a human being in self defence, or in defence of habitation, property or person, against one who manifestly intends or endeavors by violence or surprise, to commit a known felony, such as murder, rape, robbery, burglary and the like, upon either, or against any persons who manifestly intend and endeavor in a riotous and tumultuous manner to enter the habitation of another, for the purpose of assaulting or offering personal violence to any person dwelling or being therein.</p><p>13. A bare fear of any of those offences, to prevent which, the homicide is alledged to have been committed, shall not be sufficient to justify the killing; it must appear that the circumstances were sufficient to excite the fears of a reasonable man, and that the party killing really acted under the influence of those fears, and not in the spirit of revenge.</p><p>14. If a person invades or trespasses on the property or habitation of another, not with an intention to commit a felony; the killing shall be murder, manslaughter or justifiable homicide, according to the circumstances of the case.</p>

<page id="GA1817.1.P97" no="GA1817.1.98" />

<p>15. If a person kills another in his defence, it must appear that the danger was so urgent and pressing, that is order to save his own life, the killing of the other was absolutely necessary; and it must appear also, that the person killed was the assailant, or that the slayer had really, and in good faith, endeavored to decline any further struggle before the mortal blow was given.</p><p>16. In no case shall a person justify the killing of another, under the pretence of necessity, unless he were wholly without fault, imputable by law, in bringing that necessity upon himself.</p><p>17. Killing a slave in the act of revolt, or when the said slave resists a legal arrest, shall be justifiable homicide.</p><p>18. In all cases, the killing or maiming a slave or person of color, shall be put upon the same footing of criminality as the killing or maiming a white man or citizen.</p><p>19. If after persuasion, remonstrance or other gentle measures used, a forcible attack and invasion on the property or habitation of another, cannot be prevented, it shall be justifiable homicide to kill the person so forcibly attacking and invading on the property or habitation of another; but it must appear that such killing was absolutely necessary to prevent such attack and invasion, and that a serious injury was intended or might accrue to the person, property or family of the person killing.</p><p>20. All other instances which stand upon the same footing of reason and justice as those enumerated, shall be justifiable homicide.</p><p>21. The homicide appearing to be justifiable, the person indicted, shall upon his trial be fully acquitted and discharged.</p><p>22. If any woman shall endeavor privately, either by herself of the procurement of others, to conceal the death of any issue of her body, male or female, which, if it were born alive, would by law be a bastard, so that it may not come to light, whether it was murdered or not, every such mother, being convicted thereof, shall suffer an imprisonment at hard labor or in solitude in the Penitentiary, for [Illegible Text] time not exceeding one year.</p>

If the same indictment charge any woman with the murder of her bastard child, as well as with the offence in the preceding section, the jury by whom such woman shall be tried, may acquit her of murder and find her guilty of concealing the death of the bastard, or acquit her of both offences: But, if the said jury shall find her guilty of the murder, they shall return no verdict upon the count for the concealment of the death of the bastard; and if any person shall counsel, advise or direct such woman to kill the child she is pregnant, or goes with, and after she is delivered of such child she kill it, every such person so advising or directing, shall be deemed accessory to such murder, and shall have the same punishment as the principal shall have.</p><p>24. The constrained presumption arising from the concealment of the death of any child, that the child, whose death is concealed, was therefore murdered by the mother, shall not be sufficient or conclusive evidence to convict the person indicted of the murder of her child, unless probable proof be given that the child was born alive, nor unless the circumstances attending it, shall be such as shall satisfy the minds of the jury, that the mother did wilfully and maliciously destroy and take away the life of such child.</p><p>25. If any person shall be charged with voluntary or involuntary manslaughter, happening in consequence of an unlawful act, it may be lawful for the Attorney or Solicitor General, to wave the felony, by leave of the court, and to [Illegible Text] against, and charge such person with a misdemeanor; and such person, on conviction, for said misdemeanor, shall be punished by paying a fineto be appropriated as the court may directnot exceeding one thousand dollars, or be imprisoned in the common jail, or both; and the Attorney or Solicitor General may, without obtaining leave of the court, charge the felony and misdemeanor in the same indictment, and the jury by whom the said person shall be tried, may find said person guilty of either charge.</p><p>26.

From the statement exhibited, it appears that in the county of Richmond, the defaulters for the years eighteen hundred and sixteen and eighteen hundred and seventeen, are Lafitte,  Co. the Corporation of Augusta, Corly  Dickerson, Joel F. Randolph, McWharter  Williams, Dark  Matheson, Benjamin Moore, and Jeriah Gray; in Columbia, Jeremiah Reace, Washington Stone, eighteen hundred and sixteen and seventeen; in Oglethorpe, Howard Beall, cashier, and John Moore, president, of the Ready Money company, and Thomas Rhodes, 1816 and 1817; in Elbert, William Woods and Archibald Stokes; in Clark, Moss  Easly; in Greene, James A.
