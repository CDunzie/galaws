Homicide is the killing of a human being of any age or sex, and is of three kinds; murder, manslaughter, and justifiable homicide.</p>

<page id="GA1833.1.P143" no="GA1833.1.148" />

<p>SEC. 2. Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being in the peace of the State, by a person of sound memory and discretion, with malice aforethought, either express or implied.</p><p>SEC. 3. Express malice is that deliberate intention, unlawfully to take away the life of a fellow-creature, which is manifested by external circumstances capable of proof.</p><p>SEC. 4. Malice shall be implied, where no considerable provocation appears, and where all the circumstances of the killing show an abandoned and malignant heart.</p><p>SEC. 5. The punishment of murder shall be death.</p><p>SEC. 6. Manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human creature, without malice, either express or implied, and without any mixture of deliberation whatever; which may be voluntary, upon a sudden heat of passion, or involuntary, in the commission of an unlawful act, or a lawful act without due caution and circumspection.</p><p>SEC. 7. In all cases of voluntary manslaughter, there must be some actual assault upon the person killing, or an attempt by the person killed to commit a serious personal injury on the person killing. Provocation by words, threats, menaces, or contemptuous jestures shall in no case be sufficient to free the person killing from the guilt and crime of murder. The killing must be the result of that sudden, violent impulse of passion, supposed to be irresistible: for if there should appear to have been an interval between the assault or provocation given, and the homicide, sufficient for the voice of season and humanity to be heard, the killing shall be attributed to deliberate revenge, and be punished as murder.</p><p>SEC. 8. Voluntary manslaughter shall be punished by confinement and labour in the penitentiary, for a term not less than two years, nor longer than four years.</p><p>SEC. 9. Involuntary manslaughter shall consist in the killing of a human being without any intention to do so; but in the commission of an unlawful act, or a lawful act, which probably might produce such a consequence, in an unlawful manner: <i>Provided</i> always, that where such involuntary killing shall happen in the commission of an unlawful act, which in its consequences naturally tends to destroy the life of a human being, or is committed in the prosecution of a riotous intent, or of a

<page id="GA1833.1.P144" no="GA1833.1.149" />

crime punishable by death or confinement in the penitentiary, the offence shall be deemed and adjudged to be murder.</p><p>SEC. 10. Involuntary manslaughter, in the commission of an unlawful act, shall be punished by confinement and labour in the penitentiary for a term not less than one year, nor longer than three years.</p><p>SEC. 11. Involuntary manslaughter in the commission or performance of a lawful act, where there has not been observed necessary discretion and caution, shall be punished by fine or imprisonment in the common jail of the county, or both, at the discretion of the court.</p><p>SEC. 12. There being no rational distinction between excusable and justifiable homicide, it shall no longer exist. Justifiable homicide is the killing of a human being, by commandment of the law in execution of public justice; by permission of the law in advancement of public justice; in self-defence, or in defence of habitation, property or person, against one who manifestly intends or endeavours by violence or surprise to commit a felony on either; or against any persons who manifestly intend and endeavour in a riotous and tumultuous manner to enter the habitation of another, for the purpose of assaulting or offering personal violence to any person, dwelling or being therein.</p><p>SEC. 13. A bare fear of any of those offences, to prevent which the homicide is alleged to have been committed, shall not be sufficient to justify the killing; it must appear that the circumstances were sufficient to excite the fears of a reasonable man, and that the party killing really acted under the influence of those fears, and not in the spirit of revenge.</p><p>SEC. 14. If after persuasion, [Illegible Text] or other gentle measures used, a forcible attack and invasion on the property or habitation of another, cannot be prevented, it shall be justifiable homicide to kill the person so forcibly attacking and invading on the property or habitation of another; but it must appear that such killing was absolutely necessary to prevent such attack and invasion, and that a serious injury was intended, or might accrue to the person, property or family of the person killing.</p><p>SEC. 15. If a person kill another in his defence, it must appear that the danger was so urgent and pressing, at the time of the killing, that in order to save his own life, the killing of the

<page id="GA1833.1.P145" no="GA1833.1.150" />

other was absolutely necessary; and it must appear also, that the person killed was the assailant, or that the slayer had really and in good faith endeavoured to decline any further struggle before the mortal blow was given.</p><p>SEC. 16. All other instances which stand upon the same footing of reason and justice as those enumerated, shall be justifiable homicide.</p><p>SEC. 17. The homicide appearing to be justifiable, the person indicted, shall, upon the trial be fully acquitted and discharged.</p><p>SEC. 18. Killing a slave in the act of revolt, or when the said slave forcibly resists a legal arrest, shall be justifiable homicide.</p><p>SEC. 19. In all cases, the killing or maiming of a slave or person of colour, or Indian in amity with the United States, shall be put upon the same footing of criminality, as the killing or maiming of a white person.</p><p>SEC. 20. If any person shall counsel, advise, or direct a woman to kill the child she is pregnant, or goes with, and after she is delivered of such child, she kill it, every such person so advising or directing, shall be deemed an accessory before the fact to such murder, and shall have the same punishment as the principal.</p><p>SEC. 21. The constrained presumption arising from the concealment of the death of any child, that the child, whose death is concealed, was therefore murdered by the mother, shall not be sufficient or conclusive evidence to convict the person indicted, of the murder of her child, unless probable proof be given that the child was born alive, nor unless the circumstances attending it shall be such as shall satisfy the minds of the jury that the mother did wilfully and maliciously destroy and take away the life of such child.</p><p>SEC. 22. If any woman shall conceal or attempt to conceal the death of any issue of her body, male or female, which if it were born alive, would by law be a bastard, so that it may not come to light whether it was murdered or not, every such mother being convicted thereof, shall be punished by fine or imprisonment in the common jail of the county, or both, at the discretion of the court.</p>

<page id="GA1833.1.P340" no="GA1833.1.345" />

of Alabama; for the co-operation of that State was earnestly invited by Georgia in the running of that line, but was withdrawn at an early period after the commencement of the survey and examinations necessary to the settlement of the boundary. Georgia was thus left to proceed alone in a demarcation which she could not longer postponefor the whole of her territory in the occupancy of the Creek tribe, and boundary on the Alabama, had just been disencumbered of the Indian title, and was now obliged to be organized fully as part of the State, and distributed among her citizens. This organization and distribution has been carried into effect, and the whole of the lands bounding on Alabama have become private property, under titles derived from the State of Georgia. To unsettle the boundary between these two States, will be, to disturb all these titles; and if a new line should be established, more favourable to Alabama than the present one, the result will be, a total failure of the title as to all those lands in Georgia which may be thrown into Alabama by such new line, of which the consequence would be an immense loss to individual proprietors, and all obligation on Georgia to make indemnity to her suffering citizens, at a cost perhaps of millions of money. These are considerations which weigh greatly with Georgia against opening again the question of the boundary line between herself and Alabama, and which the committee trust, will be treated by Alabama as worthy of her most serious regard.</p><p>In addition to the foregoing views, the committee would state, that the government of the United States was also invited by Georgia to take a part in running the existing line, but declined so doing: that government, and not the State of Alabama, is the proprietor of the private right of soil in the lands, the title of which is to be disturbed by unsettling the present boundary. The course pursued both by the general government and Alabama heretofore, and the deep stake which Georgia and her citizens have acquired in the maintenance of the present line, ought, as your committee conceive, to lead both Alabama and the federal government to acquiesce, unless it can be shown that the boundary line established by Georgia is palpably and materially a wrong one. Georgia conceives the line marked out by herself to be rightful and just to all the parties interested: the general government has always acquiesced in it, and does not now seek to disturb it, although concerned deeply in the question, as the proprietor of the territory involved in the question on one side. Should however our sister state Alabama continue to think it important to open the question and unsettle the boundary now existing, the committee would say, that whilst Georgia should abstain from doing any act which could be construed as

<page id="GA1833.1.P341" no="GA1833.1.346" />

a consent on her part to opening the question of boundary, yet she ought to extend all courtesy to Alabama, in making such surveys and examinations as that State may deem requisite, to ascertaining for herself the line of boundary which she may deem the most just, and conformable to the articles of agreement and cession of 1802. And after such ascertainment shall have been made by Alabama, and announced to Georgia, and the points of dispute and the amount of territory involved in the controversy thus fixed and known to both parties, it will be due time for Georgia to consider and determine what course would be most proper for the adjustment of any differences of opinion that may exist.</p><p>The committee therefore submit the following Resolution:</p><p><i>Resolved, by the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of Georgia, in General Assembly met,</i> That the State of Georgia will extend all comity and facility to Alabama, in making such examinations as that State may judge necessary in relation to the boundary line between herself and Georgia; but at the same time the State of Georgia declines doing any act which may be construed as opening anew the question of boundary between the two States.</p><p><i>Resolved also,</i> That his excellency the Governor be directed to transmit a copy of the foregoing Report and Resolution to the Executive of Alabama.</p><p><i>In Senate,</i> agreed to, 21st Dec. 1833.</p><p>JACOB WOOD,</p><p>President of the Senate.</p><p>AttestJOHN A.

Your Committee cannot perceive that an immediate sale of all the public lands as proposed by the resolutions of the state of Tennessee, would be expedient or beneficial, and however laudable the object the legislature of Tennessee had in view in the proposed disposition of the proceeds thereof, as a permanent fund for the purposes of education, yet your committee are of opinion, that the disposition of the lands would interfere with the true policy of the Government, with regard to its western territory, (to wit:) The speedy occupation of that territory by actual settlers; and further that such an immense body of lands at once thrown into the market, at reduced prices, as is contemplated by those resolutions, would place it in the power of a combination of wealthy individuals, to purchase up those lands, for the purpose of speculating upon their fellow citizens, who might wish to become, and who under the present system, can become, however poor they may be, the actual settlers of the country.</p><p>Your committee cannot perceive that the land bill, introduced into the Senate of the United States by Mr. Clay, and passed by that body, provides for the distribution of the public lands in

that equitable manner contemplated by the States in their several deeds of cession.</p><p>The Government of the United States have already acted upon a liberal policy towards the new states in admitting them into the Union upon an equality with the old states as speedily as their numerical population would warrant their admission; there can therefore be no good reason why those new states should be entitled to any advantages in the distribution of the proceeds of the public lands, over the original states by whom these lands were purchased or ceded.</p><p>However acceptable to the people of Georgia the receipt of her dividend from the proposed sales might be, yet your committee regret that they perceive in this proposed distribution of a large portion of the revenues of the General Government, among the several states, only on another method about to be adopted, to reduce those revenues, and thereby create a necessity and furnish an excuse to the majority in Congress for entailing still longer upon the people of the South, the unjust and odious Tariff system.</p><p>Your committee therefore respectfully recommend the adoption of the following resolutions:</p><p><i>Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of Georgia, in General Assembly met,</i> That the General Assembly disapprove of the resolutions of the General Assembly of the state of Tennessee, of the 21st December, 1831, in relation to the sale and disposition of the public lands of the United States.</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That the General Assembly admit the correctness of the views taken on the subject, in the four first resolutions of the General Assembly of the state of Massachusetts of the 28th March, 1833, but cannot admit the policy or expediency of a distribution of any part of the revenues of the General Government among the several states, so long as any part of those revenues are raised upon the principle of a protective Tariff of duties on foreign imports.</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That our Senators in Congress be instructed, and our Representatives requested, to oppose the passage of any law, having for its object the distribution of the proceeds of the sale of the public lands of the United States among the several states;

Your committee, whilst on the subject, cannot but remark, that under the management of the present principal keeper, the situation, health and morals of the convicts, have been greatly improved; and the institution, instead of being a burden on the treasury, has supported itself and left a handsome balance. The principal keeper receives but the same salary that his predecessors did, who were furnished with a good dwelling house and fire wood, but since the destruction of that institution, the present keeper has furnished his own dwelling and wood. Your committee are of opinion, that it requires as much talent and responsibility, and infinitely more labour to discharge the duties of principal keeper of the Penitentiary, as it does to discharge the duties of secretary of state, or others of the state house officers, they would therefore respectfully recommend, that he should be placed upon the same footing with them.</p><p>Your committee would therefore recommend to both branches of the Legislature, the adoption of the following resolution:</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That the inspectors of the Penitentiary, be directed to cause the construction of such buildings, and also such repairs made to the work shops as they may deem necessary, for the benefit of the institution.</p><p>In Senate.

Franklin, executrix of Col. Bedney Franklin, late Solicitor General of the Ocmulgee Circuit, deceased, and the matters connected therewith, have had the same under serious consideration, and ask leave to make the following report:</p>

<page id="GA1833.1.P377" no="GA1833.1.382" />

<p>From the facts submitted to your committee, and which have been examined by them, it appears that the judgment against which the memorialist seeks relief, was obtained in the superior court, held in and for the county of Clark, at the February term of said court, 1833, on the appeal trial, the former [Illegible Text] being for the defendants, the cause of action being for money alleged to have been collected by Col. Bedney Franklin in 1816, and before that time, whilst he was acting as Solicitor General of the Ocmulgee Circuit, and which it was contended, had not been paid over to the state. The suit was instituted by the Central Bank, since its incorporation in 1828, and a verdict in 1833, rendered against the executors of Col. Franklin. The late Solicitor General died in the fall of 1816, a very short time after his return from the circuit. The memorialist at the sessions of the legislature in 1817, 1818, 1819, and at different periods since that time, urged an investigation of the matter and that the accounts might be adjusted, as she had every reason to believe that the state was largely indebted to her testator, for services rendered by him to the state, and the subject of investigation was more especially urged, as the papers and management of the affairs appertaining to the Solicitor's office upon his death went into other hands, by executive and legislative appointment. Various resolutions having been passed by the legislature, and committees appointed, who have made reports to be found on the journals of the legislature. In consequence of the death of Col. Franklin, the removal and deaths of the clerks and sheriffs of the different counties, and the indistinct recollection of facts occurring so long since, would naturally deprive the defendants, who were only the representatives of another, of the power to avail themselves of such facts as perhaps really existed, and which might have presented a substantial defence to the action.</p><p>From the great length of time elapsed since the alleged collection of the money, and the death of Col. Franklin in 1816, until rendition of judgment in 1833, it appears to your committee, that justice could not be done the parties, and that any verdict which might be rendered could not be considered as settling the facts with certainty, this delay of some fifteen years between the death of Col. Franklin and the institution of the suit against the executors, your committee think, is not in the slightest degree to be imputed to the memorialist. Your committee cannot say the money was not collected, but from facts which do exist, though they might not present a sufficient defence at law, yet advance strong claims on the consideration and magnanimity of the legislature for relief. These facts negative the presumption,

<page id="GA1833.1.P378" no="GA1833.1.383" />

that the money (if collected) was ever applied to the use of the late Solicitor General, or that it came to the hands of his executors.</p><p>Col. Franklin, during his life, and in his intercourse with men, was esteemed as strictly honest and honourable, free from the vice of gambling, and not extravagant in his expenses or in his style of living. By a reference to the returns of his taxable property of file in the comptroller's office, it appears that in 1808, he returned fourteen slaves and sundry tracts of land, in 1817, the year following his decease, the memorialist as his representative, returned only twenty-one slaves and sundry parcels of land, showing but a very reasonable increase of his property in the eight years preceding his death, at a time when he enjoyed an extensive and lucrative practice. These facts, in connection with the continued and urgent manner in which the memorialist urged an investigation of the matter, appear to afford conclusive evidence to your committee, that the amount of eleven thousand dollars, could not have been used by Col. Franklin, and that it never came into the hands of his executors.</p><p>The following facts, in the opinion of your committee, may perhaps show how the deficit occurred. Col. Franklin, whilst he was acting as Solicitor General of the Ocmulgee Circuit, twice and perhaps three times, in the presence of Judge Shorter, deposited large packages of public money in the post office, whilst on the circuit, directed to the treasurer of the state, because Col. Franklin considered it useless to carry such large sums with him around the circuit. He was also in the habit of leaving large amounts with the sheriffs and clerks, until it was convenient to call for the same, when he visited Milledgeville, for the purpose of paying the amounts collected into the treasury.</p><p>From the statement of Geo. R. Clayton, it appears that no money was ever received at the treasury from Col. Franklin, through the post office, and it is possible the packages may have been abstracted by dishonest post masters, or applied to the individual use of those with whom it may have been left for safe keeping by Col. Franklin, after his death. Your committee would further state, that the memorialist had no notice of the claim against her testator, until long after the administration and distribution of almost the entire estate of Col. Franklin.</p><p>The statute of limitations being a quieting statute, and the reason of the statute applying to claims in favour of the state as well as those of an individual, and not believing in the prerogative

<page id="GA1833.1.P379" no="GA1833.1.384" />

maxim, no time runs against the king, when applied to our government and free institutions; your committee think, that the length of time which the state has slept over its rights alone should in justice and in equity, bar the present claim against the memorialist, who is only the representative of one, who, had he been living, could long since have accounted for the money, if it had ever been collected. Your committee beg leave therefore, under conviction of the fair claims of the memorialist to relief, to recommend the passage of the following resolution:</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That his Excellency the Governor, and the Directors of the Central Bank, be, and they are hereby authorized and requested, to instruct John H. Howard, the attorney prosecuting said case, to suspend all further proceedings on the judgment obtained at February term, 1833, of Clark superior court, against the executors of Col. Bedney Franklin, deceased, late Solicitor General of the Ocmulgee Circuit, in favour of the Central Bank, and to enter a remittitur of the judgment, except the costs, on the minutes of said court, on their paying the attorney's fees for prosecuting the same.</p><p>In the House of Representatives, agreed to, 12th Dec. 1333.</p><p>THOMAS GLASCOCK,</p><p>Speaker of the House of Representatives.</p><p>AttestJOSEPH STURGIS, Clerk.</p><p><i>In Senate,</i> concurred in, 17th Dec. 1833.</p><p>JACOB WOOD,</p><p>President of the Senate.</p><p>AttestJOHN A.

The first obstacle presented to the <i>efficient</i> discharge of those duties, was the unqualified refusal of the president and directors of said Bank to submit their books and papers to the inspection of your committee. A formal protest under their order was presented, in which the investigation directed by the supreme legislative authority of the State, was denouneed as a proceeding illegal, utterly subversive of private right, an assumption

<page id="GA1833.1.P395" no="GA1833.1.400" />

of power, which, under the constitution, the legislature cannot exercise. This lofty tone of presumptuous defiance, against the authority of the highest tribunal recognised by the constitution and the people of the State, adopted by this banking interest, a mere creature of the legislature, and owing every moment of its existence to the forbearance of that body, seemed well to become the arrogance of an in inflated aristocracy, more gratified at the possession of power to abuse, than respect to those whose interests are affected by its exercise for the virtuous use of it, and placed in bold relief the shameless desperation which violated confidence, fraught with its excesses, was capable of assuming.</p><p>Your committee, entertaining no doubt as to the visitorial powers of the legislature over this institution, hesitated not to overrule the grounds of protest presented to them, and required the president and directors to appear before them, in furtherance of the objects of their appointment, and to produce the books of the Bank. So fearful had those immediately connected with this Bank [Illegible Text], that their conduct might meet the public eye, by an order of the board, passed on the first day of the session of the committee, the books were taken from the possession of the cashier pro tem, and deposited in the Bank, not to be removed unless by an order of the board; and in reply to the subp[oelig]na of your committee, the president and their directors, being all the board, on their oaths stated that the books were not and had not been in their power to produce them, for that they were deposited in Bank, subject to removal only by the order of the board, and no such order existed. This studied evasion of the subp[oelig]na of your committee was not permitted to have its effect; the showing was declared insufficient, and the books ordered to be produced. In the mean time, a rule had been served upon said president and directors, as individuals, to show cause why an attachment should not issue against them, for refusing to attend in person and testify before the committee.</p><p>The same grounds assumed in the protest of the Bank were relied upon by them in answer to this rule, and in aid of their defence asked to be heard by their counsel. As this was a question affecting the personal liberties of individuals, your committee would have felt bound to grant their request. To have done this, would necessarily have consumed much time; and as the committee were required to report to the present session of the legislature, and as much testimony had been collected apart from that which was sought from the Bank, and of a similar character, embracing the most important subjects of inquiry;

<page id="GA1833.1.P396" no="GA1833.1.401" />

and as the judge of the middle circuit was absent, so that your committee could not obtain the interference of the judiciary if they had desired its aid in the last extremityfarther proceedings against the president and directors, as individuals and officers, were suspended. Had not the object of their appointment, however, been fully accomplished, in despite of all the opposition of the Bank, your committee would have felt called upon to exhaust all the means placed, as they conceived, within their power, in order to have attained it. For it is justly doubted, whether such perfect exemption from accountability has ever before been claimed for, or conceded to, any banking institution. One thing is certain, that when such exemption is granted as a matter of right, there is no longer any security to the interests of the people. Nothing short of a resort to just principles can release them from the machinations of avarice, or the unhallowed designs of fraud. Your committee are compelled to place a different estimate upon the chartered rights of banking institutions, from that which has been gratuitously adopted by the Merchants' and Planters' Bank: they are mere corporations, designed to subserve some public good; when they refuse or fail to act out the objects of their design, their powers are subject to revocation, or amendment, as the public good requires. To ascertain the manner or extent of action on the part of the creating power, justice to the institution itself requires the exercise of this visitorial power, and duty to the country brings it into operation. If, however, this right of exemption claimed, and attempted to be recognised, does in truth exist, it is a matter of great moment that the community should be cautious in its favouritism of those institutions, in whose notes they place a large portion of their property, and which may speculate upon their interest without the fear of accountability.</p><p>In reviewing the facts disclosed by the witnesses who were called upon to testify before your committee, little can be said complimentary of the faithful management of the Merchants' and Planters' Bank. The duty which its managers owed to the public, as a banking institution, has been entirely forgotten, while the interests of that public have been rendered entirely subservient to the private speculations of a <i>very few persons,</i> who have been placed at its head as directors and stockholders.</p><p>The first point to which the investigation of the committee was directed, was, as to the manner in which the institution went into operation. Upon a minute and diligent examination of this preliminary question, the confident opinion is expressed, that the Merchants' and Planters' Bank never did have any legal existence whatever. By the charter of incorporation, the

<page id="GA1833.1.P397" no="GA1833.1.402" />

stockholders are authorized to elect nine directors for the management of the affairs of the institution, so soon as gold and silver coin, to the amount of twenty per cent. of the subscription for the said stock shall have been received. After the election shall take place, the directors are authorized to receive the money subscribed for stock from commissioners, and shall forthwith thereafter commence the operations of said Bank, at the city of Augusta.</p><p>According then, to the obvious meaning of the charter, the bank cannot commence until the directors are elected, the directors cannot be elected until gold and silver coin to the amount of 20 per cent. of the subscriptions to said stock shall have been paid in. Now your committee would inquire, if this indispensable pre-requisite had ever been complied with when the bank commenced operations? We answer, unhesitatingly, that it had not. From the testimony of the witnesses it appears that the subscription for the stock of the bank was paid partly in specie and partly in bank bills. Mr. Henry, cashier of the Branch of the State Bank, at Augusta, states that on the 22d of April, 1828, ten thousand dollars were deposited in that bank to the credit of the commissioners of the Merchants' and Planters' Bank; it was withdrawn 4th December of the same year; the deposite was made in current <i>bank notes.</i> Mr. Edward Thomas, then a commissioner of said bank, and now a director and stockholder, requested that the deposits making in current bank notes should be represented by a certificate as a specie deposit, with a pledge that coin would not be demanded; a certificate for the amount of ten thousand dollars was granted. Mr. Hale, president of the same bank, states that the certificate was given upon an understanding between himself and Mr. Wheeler, a large stockholder, and president of the Merchants' and Planters' bank, that no more specie should be drawn than was deposited, and that no more was drawn than had been agreed upon. The object was to enable the bank to go into operation.</p><p>Another deposite was likewise made of twenty thousand dollars, as Mr. Hale states; a certificate of specie deposite for this amount was refused by the board. A certificate of the usual character was given, which was endorsed by the president of the bank, Mr. Hale, in his individual character, guaranteeing the payment in specie, if required. The time when this deposite was withdrawn is not known; but Mr. Hale states that when withdrawn, it was paid in the bills of city banks, and not in specie. Mr. Ansly, who was an original stockholder, and one of the first directors, and was present at the first meeting

<page id="GA1833.1.P398" no="GA1833.1.403" />

of the board of directors, states that the bank had funds deposited in the State Bank at Augusta, for which they had a certificate, and which they treated as specie. Mr. Jussap states, that deposite was never resumed to specie, which could have been controlled by commissioners. Then the capital stock of the bank consisted of a specie certificate for ten thousand dollars, received with the understanding that it was not to be paid in specie, and a certificate for twenty thousand dollars, not payable in specie, but endorsed by a private individual, that it should be paid in specie if required. But if we could mistake the object of these singular movements upon the part of this bank, all doubt will be removed by the testimony of Mr. Heard, who states that Mr. Thomas stated to him, that their only object in getting the specie certificate was to present it to the Governor, in order that the Merchants' and Planters' bank might go into operation, and that the specie would never be required. This is what constitutes the 20 per cent. of gold and silver even required to be paid by the charter before the bank commenced its operations. As well might the stockholders have paid their subscriptions for stock in their individual notes, the charter would have been as strictly complied with in the one instance as the other. Upon such a palpable infraction of the charter your committee will forbear to comment.</p><p>Another material violation of the charter of the Merchants' and Planters' Bank, has consisted in an utter disregard of the fourth article of its constitution. By that article it is expressly enjoined, that not less than <i>five</i> directors shall constitute a board for the transaction of business, of whom the president shall be one. Now, by the testimony of Mr. Barnes, who has been connected with the bank as discount clerk since May 1828, it is proven that both bills and notes have been discounted by a less number than five directors. That the president alone sometimes discounted bills, and that for some time past the affairs of the bank have been managed entirely by Messrs. Wheeler, Thomas, Holocombe, and Bridges. By the testimony of Mr. Stewart, it appears that the president and cashier alone or together, frequently discounted bills of exchange without consulting the board. If discounting notes and bills of exchange with less number than five directors be not transacting business in direct violation of the charter, your committee are utterly unable to conceive of any violation whatever. Another violation of the charter of this institution has been the election of individuals as directors who were not stockholders. This may be justified in some instances, upon the ground that the stock book deems them to be such; yet your committee cannot countenance such an evasion of an express requisition, when it

<page id="GA1833.1.P399" no="GA1833.1.404" />

is disclosed to them by the testimony, that the transfer was merely nominal, intending to vest no interest and designed as a mere formality, which no other subterfuge could effect.</p><p>From the returns of the list of stockholders it appears that there were but seven persons [who, according to the charter] could have [been] appointed as directors in the bank. And from the sequel of the history of this institution, it is manifest that it was no part of the policy of a few largely interested, that any one should be brought into the management of its concerns, who might disclose the gross imprudences of which they were guilty. Your committee sought assiduously to learn the causes of failure of this institution, and feel satisfied that they have been enabled to accomplish their object. The bank has no capital; the stock to a very large extent was represented by the notes and bills of stockholders. The discount of the bank had been made to its directors, and they were unable to reduce their notes to meet the calls made on the bank for the redemption of their bills which had been paid out upon their discounts. The proportion of debts due the bank, besides those of its three directors and president was very small. By the testimony of Mr. Barnes and the acknowledgments of Mr. Wheeler, it appears that at the time of the failure of this bank, there was owing to the bank by all its debtors other than its president and three directors, only eighty thousand dollars; while the debts of these individuals could have varied but little from half a million of dollars. Mr. Barnes states that at the time of the failure of the bank, its four directors owed to it independently of exchange, fully two hundred thousand dollars. He further states that the amounts of seventy-eight thousand dollars, being exchange payable in New York, and of one hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars exchange, payable in Savannah, as per the last report made in October, were papers of the directors reciprocally drawn and reciprocally endorsed, and that a part of these bills of exchange represented the capital stock of the bank, and instead of being forwarded for collection, have remained in its vaults ever since its failure. This fact is confirmed by the representation of Mr. Thomas, one of the directors, to Mr. Kendrick. And in a conversation with Mr. Stewart, Mr. Thomas expressly declared that the greater part of exchange running to maturity, as referred to in the report to the Governor, was exchange given for the payments of instalments on stock; that that clause of the charter which prohibited them from pledging their stock to the bank, left them no alternative but to give this exchange for that purpose, which was the only way of evading that clause of the charter. The failure of this institution is a matter wholly inexplicable to your committee,

<page id="GA1833.1.P400" no="GA1833.1.405" />

if the officers have kept truth in view in their annual report to the Governor, and in their representation of its condition to the community, such has been the confidence of the community in its solvency that its stock had advanced to 30 per cent. premium, dividends were declared at and after the rate of eight per cent. per annum.</p><p>In 1829 it reported a reserved fund and undivided profits of $14,944, in 1830 of $27,668, in 1831 of $44,418, in 1832 of $23,060, and even on the 1st day of April, 1833, it reports a circulation of $393,491, amount due other banks, dividends unclaimed, and individual deposits amounting in all to $418,803, with notes and bills of exchange, reported as good, specie, bills of other banks, amount due by other banks, real and personal estate, amounting to $659,981, to meet that debit, and yet in the short space of six weeks, the bank failed, and its notes 66 per cent. below par. How comes this sudden reverse of fortune! Has the bank suffered any heavy losses? Mr. Barnes, its now acting cashier says, that from its commencement the bank has suffered no losses of consequence. How then shall we regard this most extraordinary failure? The report on the first of April, comes presented with the solemn sanction of an oath as to its truth, yet in the short space of six weeks, the directors of that bank, under whose very eye that return must have passed, are proclaiming that its bills can never be worth more than they were then, and their then depreciation 66 per cent.</p><p>Your committee will leave these inconsistencies to be reconciled by those who have created them. They cannot pass however, from this branch of their report, without bestowing the most unqualified censure upon the conduct of those, who, by false representations, have succeeded in gaining the confidence of the community for this institution, then, by their imprudence for their own gain, have shamefully betrayed it to ruin.</p><p>From the testimony of the acting cashier, it appears that there are now bills in circulation of this bank, to the amount of $98,000. The amount reported in circulation on the first of April last, was $393,000, which shows an amount withdrawn from circulation since that time, and the greater portion since the failure, of $205,000, and how has this been done? In the first place, John W. Bridges, Edward Thomas, John C. Holcombe and Joseph Wheeler, being the almost entire stockholders in the bank, and the only directors, discounted their own notes at their own bank, for such sums as their wishes dictated. The bills of the Merchants' and Planters' Bank, were thus,

<page id="GA1833.1.P401" no="GA1833.1.406" />

through its directors, thrown into circulation, and all the advantages of their credit afforded solely to those directors. These bills returned upon the bank for payment, the bank was unable to meet the demand, it closed its doors, and its bills depreciated far below their nominal value. The difference between their depreciated and nominal value, became the profits of those who had received and passed them at the one, and were now able to buy them at the other. Those who were thus situated, were the directors, the stockholders over the very bank itself, for no one comparatively, could have any interest in this depreciation; all were opposed to it save those very directors themselves, for all must lose, and nonesave them, could gain. A public sale of the property of Holcombe, Bridges, Thomas, and Wheeler, was had for bills on the Merchants' and Planters' Bank; and instead of the injured community meeting from the hands of their oppressors recompence for their necessities, were publicly appealed to by the president of the bank in an admonition, that the bills of the bank were not worth one half of their nominal value. The sales thus effected reached beyond $68,000, while the real value of the property sold, did not equal one half the amount. It is thus that the misfortunes of the people have been speculated upon by the very men who were the sole instruments in bringing down upon the sufferers those misfortunes; but this injustice has not stopped here; these same directors have themselves entered into the market, and become the purchasers of their own bills at that depreciation of value which they have caused, and these bills thus bought have been returned to the bank in payment of their own notes to that institution. Amply possessed of the means to control the value of these bills, these directors, or at least some of them, have entered into a still more unwarrantable speculation of them, and bought and sold them for a profit. Nor has the bank itself been disposed to permit this golden harvest for speculation to pass by unheeded. Its own property has been exposed to sale for its own bills, and double price received for it. But the insidious temptation of speculation, had too many inducements to limit here, the indulgence of this bank, while it denied payment at its counter for its bills, it was enabled to furnish the means in the hands of a friend to shave up its own paper, and to pocket for itself the profits of the job. Mr. Campbell states, that at the time of the failure, he had a note in the bank, to pay which, he bought its bill at 35 per cent. discount; upon presentation, the bank desired that he should not pay his note with these depreciated bills, as he had not so received them, and at their request, he permitted the bank to take them at the same rate per cent. discount, at which he had obtained them, and for which he received current bills.</p>

<page id="GA1833.1.P402" no="GA1833.1.407" />

<p>With a consciousness of these glaring truths, well might the Merchants' and Planters' Bank protest against the investigation directed by the legislaturewell might they seek to hide from public scrutiny their illegal proceedings, and the use of means which have proven utterly subversive of private right.</p><p>Your committee will not venture an opinion as to the future redemption of the bills of this institution. The facts presented to them were not sufficiently authentic to justify any decided opinion. It was, however, the opinion of Mr. Barnes, one of the officers of the Bank, and wholly disinterested in it, that the bills would eventually be redeemed at par value. There is a provision of the charter, however, which subjects the person and property of the original stockholders, and those holding stock by transfer, to the payment of its bills, in proportion to the amount of stock ownedby which, some of the holders of the bills have been enabled to obtain not only the amount of the bills, but the cost of suit and interest upon these bills, as the testimony of Mr. Miller shows. The spirit of favouritism, which seems to have influenced the operations of this Bank, while in character, appears not to have forsaken it now in disreputefor while creditors at home have sacrificed their claims at various losses from 12 to 66 per cent. discount, a debt of 16 or 18,000 dollars has been paid, dollar for dollar, to the firm of Ogden, Ferguson  Co. of New York. It is difficult to recognise the propriety of injury being sustained by the citizens of our State, while those of other States are held harmless from loss; and it would be unjust to suggest that any farther or greater sacrifice should be submitted to, by those who have as yet alone submitted to it.</p><p>One fact more, and your committee will conclude. Oppression to this Bank has been resorted to, for the purpose of directing public censure from the authors of this wanton injury upon the rights and property of the people of Georgia. To the unjustifiable imprudence of the Bank can alone be attributed their misfortune, and our injury.</p><p>This institution was not compelled to suspend its operations because the funds which it had reported but a few days before to the executive department as <i>solvent,</i> were not <i>available</i> to relieve its pressurebut because those funds thus reported were not solvent. The Bank had sought a loan from the several Banks of the city of Augusta of 100,000 dollars, to sustain itself. An assurance was given it by the president of the Branch State Bank, that if it would permit two disinterested and competent persons to examine its condition, and they should report it solvent,
