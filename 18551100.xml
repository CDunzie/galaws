<notediv><title><b>PREFACE.</b><br set="CENTER" /></title><note><p>The compilation of the Laws passed at the Biennial Session of the Generally Assembly of Georgia, of 1855 and 1856, differs from preceding Compilations, in the abbreviation of the enacting and repealing clauses of each Law. This change was adopted by the Compiler, in conformity with the following communication, addressed to him by his Excellency, the Governor:</p><p>EXECUTIVE CHAMBER,</p><p>MILLEDGEVILLE, GA, MARCH 6TH, 1856.</p><p>DEAR SIR:</p><p>In proceeding to the discharge of your duties in preparing for publication the Laws of the late General Assembly, you are hereby authorized in consideration of the unusually great number of Acts that were passed at the recent Session, as well as their great size, to abbreviate the enacting and repealing clauses of each act, with a view to promote economy and compactness in the compilation.</p><p>I am, Respectfully,</p><p>HERSCHEL V. JOHNSON,</p><p>Governor.</p><p>To J. W. DUNCAN, Esq. Compiler, c.</p><p>The result of this modification, has been to reduce the size of the volume very greatly, as well as the expense of the publication to the State.</p><p>The annotations, which it is made the duty of the Compiler to make, under the law of 1852, are not as extensive or as complete as was desired by him that they should be, in consequence of the anxiety expressed, publicly and privately, that the Laws should be printed at the earliest possible day. Indeed, the number of Laws passed, has increased to such an extent since the Act of 1852 has been in force, that it would be impossible to do anything like full justice in the time allotted to the preparation of the work. Hence, preferring to gratify the public desire to see the Laws, rather than to elaborate the annotations, they will not be found as numerous as might be under different circumstances.</p><p>Respectfully submitted by</p><p><b>THE COMPILER.</b></p></note></notediv><notediv><title>EXPLANATORY NOTE.<br set="CENTER" /></title><note><p>Wherever a clerical mistake appears, which might materially change the language of the Legislature, the words necessary to make the object complete, have been inserted in brackets. In one instance, two entire sections were omitted in the enrolment of a Law; and they have been given in full, with an explanatory note.</p><p>Important variations between the Engrossed Acts, and the Enrolled Laws, have also been given.</p></note></notediv><body><part><preface><p><b>STATUTES OF GEORGIA,</b> PASSED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF 1855  1856.</p><p>PUBLISHED BY AUTHORITY.</p><p>HERSCHEL V.
