<notediv><title><b>PREFACE.</b><br set="CENTER" /></title><note><p>The following Compilation of the Laws passed by the Legislature of Georgia, in the year 1857, does not vary materially in plan or arrangement from former Compilations of previous Legislatures. The usual enacting and repealing clauses have been greatly abridgbed, as in the former Compilation by Mr. Duncan, in accordance with the instructions of his Excellency the Governor; a copy of which is here inserted, to-wit:</p><p>EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,</p><p>Milledgeville, Georgia, December 26th, 1857.</p><p><b>SIR:</b></p><p>In Compiling the Laws passed by the General Assembly at the late Session, with the view of avoiding unnecessary expense in printing and publishing, you are authorized to abbreviate the enacting and repealing clauses of each Act, where such abbreviations will not, in the least, alter the meaning of the Act, in conformity with the plan of compiling the laws of 1855-6, adopted by J. W. Duncan, Esq., in obedience to the order of Governor Johnson.</p><p>Yours, respectfully,  c.,</p><p><b>JOSEPH E. BROWN,</b></p><p>Governor.</p><p>E. N. BROYLES, Esq., Compiler.</p><p>The annotations to the public acts are as full and appropriate as the plan of the compilation and the time allowed for its completion would conveniently admit. In regard to the decisions of our Supreme Court, the Compiler has not confined himself to the letter of the law, which requires reference to be made to such of those decisions only as have been made since the last publication of the Laws, c. Where a Statute repeals or modifies an old and established principle of law, reference is made to such decisions as contain and assert such principle without regarding the time when they may have been made, whether before or since the last publication of the Laws. This course, it is believed, will prove more useful and satisfactory to all.</p><p>There were two Bills, which, by a mere oversight, the Speaker of the House of Representatives did not sign. Hence they are not laws, and are not inserted in this Compilation. The Constitution (article 1, section 17th, Cobb's Dig. p. 1114) requiring that all Acts shall be signed by the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House, c.</p><p>One of those Acts authorized an appeal from the return of Commissioners appointed to set apart a year's support for the widow, c. upon the death of her husband. The other incorporated the Merchants and Mechanics Mutual Insurance Company, in the city of Macon.</p><p>Two Acts that were passed are not inserted in this Compilation, because there are two others the same throughout with them respectively. The numbers, however, are inserted in their proper places. See Nos. 195 and 276, and notes thereto.</p><p>Respectfully submitted,</p><p>E. N. BROYLES, Compiler.</p></note></notediv><notediv><title>EXPLANATORY NOTE.<br set="CENTER" /></title><note><p>Wherever in the Engrossed Acts and the Enrolled Laws, a word, obviously wrong, was used, or the use of an important word was omitted, the proper word has been inserted in brackets, followed by a mark of interrogation. Important variations between the Engrossed Acts and the Enrolled, have also been noted.</p></note></notediv><body><part><preface><p><b>STATUTES OF GEORGIA,</b> PASSED BY THE <b>GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF 1857</b></p><p>PUBLISHED BY AUTHORITY.</p><p>JOSEPH E.
