Each individual stockholder, by his acceptance of the charter, becomes a party to the contract and is bound by all its provisions. <i>Ib.</i></p><p>3. One of a company of stockholders, who participated in the illegal organization of a bank, upon a spurious and not a specie basis as required by the charter, cannot, under the invidual liability clause, maintain a suit upon the unpaid bills of the bank, against another stockholder; and evidence is admissible to show the fraudulent manner in which the Bank was put in operation. 19 <i>Ga. R. p.</i> 337</p><p>4. Where the shares of a Bank are transferred by A. to B. without consideration, and without the knowledge or consent of B., B. is not the <i>owner</i> in contemplation of the charter, and can only be made liable on the gronnd of fraud, <i>e. g.</i> acquiescing in the transfer, after the fact is brought to his notice, for the benefit of some other person, and to the injury of the creditors of the corporation. <i>Ib</i></p><p>5. In fixing the ownership of stock, it is not competent to give in evidence the declarations of the officers and agents of the Bank, for that purpose. Third persons are not bound by their sayings. <i>Ib.</i></p><p>6. It is not proper to screen a stockholder from responsibility, under an individual liability clause in a Bank charter, to prove that assets sufficient to pay the creditors were turned over by the corporation to an assignee, chosen and selected by itself, and over whom the corporation had, by law, co-ordinate control with the creditors. <i>Ib.</i></p><p>7. Conceding the common law rule, that upon the dissolution of a corporation, the debts due to and from it are extinguished, still it is competent for the Legislature to interpose and prevent such a result; and having done so, it is not in the power of the Courts to render a judgment, containing the declared will of the Legislature; any such attempt would be an excess of jurisdiction, which would render its proceedings certainly voidable, if not absolutely void. <i>Ib.</i></p><p>8. In a suit against a stockholder in a bank, the transfer book is evidence. 20 <i>Ga. R. p.</i> 275.</p><p>9. The directors are liable for an excess of issues; and the bill-holder by releasing the directors, releases the stockholders. <i>Ib.</i></p><p>10.

<p>12. An Act of the Cashier, known to and ratified by the Directors, binds the Bank. <i>Ib</i></p><p>13. To enable creditors to render stockholders liable for fraud, they must show that they gave credit from something said or done by the members amounting to a deceit. 22 <i>Ga. R. p.</i> 848.</p><p>14. By the expiration of the charter of the Commercial Bank of Macon, the liability of the Directors under the 8th section for the payment of bills issued in excess, became [Illegible Text]. 221 <i>Ga. p.</i> 513.</p><p>15. For a stockholder in a banking or other corporation in this State, who is personally liable, to dischargeh imself from liability for the notes or other contracts of such Bank or other corporation upon a transfer of his stock, it is necessary under the Act of 1838, (<i>Cobb</i> 112,) that he should give notice once a month for six months, of such transfer, and immediately after the same is made in two newspapers in or nearest the place where such Bank or other corporations, shall keep their principal office; and even then, he is not exempt from the claim of a creditor who has given him written notice thereof within six months after the transfer is made. 22 <i>Ga. p.</i> 86.</p><p>16 Where a stockholer of a corporation is made individually liable upon an execution issuing against the corporation, he is entitled to the remedy by illegality, the same as any other defendant in <i>fi. fa. Ib.</i></p><p>17. By 15th section of Act of 1822, to secure the solvency of all the banking institutions in this State, the paper discounted and held by a bank, is payable in the bills of the bank. 24 <i>Ga. p</i> 249.</p><p>18. The appointment of a receiver does not affect the right of the debtor to pay in the bills of the Bank. <i>Ib</i></p><p>19. When the capital stock of an incorporated Bank, is subscribed and paid in, it constitutes a trust fund for the benefit of the stockholders; but when notes are issued and circulated thereon, another and superior trust arises, and the stock must be first applied to the payment of the notes of the Bank. 24 <i>Ga. p.</i> 273.</p><p>20. If the charter requires a certain amount of the capital stock to be paid in before the notes can be issued, but the directors nevertheless proceed to issue notes, if the Bank fail or become insolvent, the billholders and creditors of the Bank may proceed at once against the stockholders and directors. <i>Ib.</i></p><p>21. If stockholders do an illegal act, or omit to do what the law requires, by which the rights of others are prejudiced, the law declares such conduct fraudulent. <i>Ib.</i></p><p>22. The assignees and successors of stockholders and directors of a Bank, are not [Illegible Text] by the fraud of their assignors and predecessors, if they become assignees and successors without fraud. <i>Ib.</i></p><p>23. An assignment by a Bank of its effects to which the creditors are not parties or consenting, cannot deprive them of the right to sue stockholders and directors for breach of duty. <i>Ib.</i></p><p>24.

A Corporation is authorized to make contracts. <i>Held,</i> That a promissory note is <i>prima facie</i> evidence of such a contract.<i>Ibid.</i></p><p>3. Proprietors of Railroads, when running their engines over crossings, must use reasonable care and diligence, taking into consideration all the circumstances of the case; and whether there has been negligence or not, depends upon the facts of each particular case, and the question is to be decided by the jury; and, notwithstanding the plaintiff may not be without fault, still, if the injury could have been prevented, in the exercise of proper and reasonable precaution on the part of the defendant, and was not, the defendant is liable.18 <i>Ga. p.</i> 680.</p><p>4.

The failure of a Railroad train to comply with the requisitions preseribed by law, does not necessarily make a road liable for damages, but it will constitute a <i>prima facie</i> case, and usually will be sufficient to establish a want of due diligence.<i>Ibid.</i></p><p>13.

Under the act of January 1852, when a cause is sent back to the Superior Courts by the Supreme Court, <i>Held</i> that a party is entitled to one continuance only under the act. 21 <i>Ga, p.</i> 581.</p><p>3. Questions that have been directly made and solemnly ajudicated by this Court, between the same parties cannot be brought up on another writ of error for reviewal. <i>1b.</i></p><p>4. The Bill of exceptions must show that the decisions complained of, were actually made, and the only proof of the fact is the certificate of the presiding Judge. 22 <i>Ga, p.</i> 168.</p><p>5. The presumption is, that the judgments of the Superior Courts are right, and the <i>onus</i> is upon the plaintiff in error, to make it appear otherwise. <i>1b.</i></p><p>6. When the fact appears only in the rule <i>nisi</i> for a new trial, that the Court refused to charge as requested, and the rule is disallowed by the Court, without stating the grounds, it is no evidence of the fact recited in the rule <i>nisi,</i> especially when the Judge certifies that he gave the charge stated in the rule, but is silent as to his refusal to charge. <i>1b.</i></p><p>7. When the decision of the Court in refusing a continuance is excepted to, the grounds of the motion must be stated. 22 <i>Ga. p.</i> 402.</p><p>8. This Court will not pass its judgment on an exception that the presiding Judge in the Court below does not admit to be correctly stated. 22 <i>Ga. p.</i> 499.</p><p>9. If an exception be not taken at the trial, it cannot be heard in this Court. 22 <i>Ga. p.</i> 574.</p><p>10. This Court will reluctantly interfere, if at all, to disturb proceedings in Superior Courts, which took place before its organization, and which were in conformity with the practice which prevailed at the period when they were had. 23 <i>Ga. p.</i> 504</p><p>11. Where the judgment of the Court below is not excepted to generally, but upon grounds which are specified, the bill of exceptions cannot be amended so as to include other grounds, upon the hearing of the cause. 24 <i>Ga. p.</i> 17.</p><p>But see 23 <i>Ga. p.</i> 371.</p><p>12. The packet containing the bill of exceptions and transcript of the record, need not be transmitted under <i>seal</i> by the Clerk of Superior to Clerk of Supreme Court. 24 <i>Ga. p.</i> 59.</p><p>13. If the clerk of the Superior Court certify that the above and foregoing is a correct and true copy from the records in my office, of the foregoing stated case, it is sufficient, and he need not use the words complete ranscript. <i>1b.</i></p><p>14. If eleven days intervene between the signing of the bill of exceptions, and filing them with the clerk, it is a substantial compliance with the act of 1856, not withstanding more than ten days elapsed from the acknowledgment of service and filing the bill of exceptions. <i>1b.</i></p><p>15. Writs of error founded on a judgment <i>granting</i> a continuance, will in future be dismissed; as in such cases, any judgment of reversal, must of necessity be futile. 24 <i>Ga. p.</i> 169.</p></note></notediv></lawdiv>

Jurors must not give their verdicts against the prisoner, without plain and manifest proof of his guilt. This rule implies that where there is a doubt, the consequence should be the acquittal of the party on trial.<i>Ibid.</i></p><p>14. The jury being the judges of the law and the facts, are not bound to go by the charge which the Court makes, as to what is the law, unless the charge truly states what the law is; and whether it does or not, the jury have the right to decide.22 G<i>a. p.</i> 478.</p><p>15. A motion to quash an indictment, is a demurrer to the indictment, and must be in writing on the arraignment and before plea pleaded.22 G<i>a. p.</i> 499.</p><p>16. When a new county is formed from an old one, and before its formation a crime was committed on the territory taken from the old county, the indictment is correct if it charge that the offence was committed in that portion of the old county which was taken to form the new one.22 G<i>a. p.</i> 515.</p>

<p>17. The presiding Judge is the trior of the competency of jurors, and his judgment in regard to the competency will be seldom interfered with. <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>18. It is not sufficient to disqualify a person as a juror to prove that he was born without the United States. It must be shown that he has not been naturalized, which may be done by his own oath, or by any competent evidence.<i>Ibid.</i></p><p>19. An indictment is sufficiently technical and correct, if it state the offence so plainly that it may be easily understood by the jury.24 G<i>a. p.</i> 191.</p><p>20. Public excitement not sufficient ground to entitle a prisoner accused of felony to a continuance, since the passage of the Act of 1856, in relation to the empannelling of jurors.24 G<i>a. p.</i> 297.</p><p>21.
