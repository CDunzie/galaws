Our servants have been our masters, and neither the laws, nor the Constitution, can protect us; could reason be left free to combat error, and the people to effect reforms, when they were needed, we should be hopeful of the future. But the facts of our present political history disclose that the very safeguard of the ballot, has been taken away from us, and by the wicked instrumentalities,

which have been corruptly devised for the express purpose of robbing the people of the power of free sufferage, we are powerless to redress our wrongs. The patriotic of all parties in the United States, can but feel how earnest the effort was in our recent Presidential election, to redress the evils which were afflicting the country, by a peaceful and honest use of the ballot, and the whole world proves how a wicked oligarchy has defeated the purpose. If fraud no longer vitiates the action of men, or States, then indeed are we hopeless, for the corrupt and lawless, who now hold power, may hold it forever; if the highest tribunal in our land, which we have fondly looked to as the last stronghold of freedom, has declared that frauds on liberty and law must stand unreversed, and irreversible, then, indeed, we are a doomed people; with the laws trampled on, the name of State sovereignty a by-word of reproach, governments, in the South, at least, set up and pulled down at will, and the fountain of justice itself polluted, it does seem that the overthrow of our common Government is imminent.
