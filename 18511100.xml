It will be seen by reference to this paper, that Major Cooper has gone into the history of the Iron business in Georgia. The partial success of some, and overthrow of others, who ventured to embark in its doubtful prosecution. That Georgia embraces within herself all the natural material to make her one of the first Iron States in the Union, or in the world, there is no doubt. That she will develope those natural resources, and build up for herself a solid wealth in that department, depends much, in the opinion of your Committee, upon the success of the pioneers in that hazardous enterprise. What will it matter that [Illegible Text] and coal, and stone and clay, lie in inexhaustible beds, and that the forest abounds in the finest and most appropriate timber, and that the best water power in the world comes, as if bidden to the very spot you would have it. If experience shows that talent and energy, and zeal, and if indefatigable and [Illegible Text] courage have labored for years with all these advantages, and reaped nothing but disappointment and overthrow, who will trust his only bark along that channel, though calm and placid its waters seem, when all who went before him have perished.</p><p>To prosecute the Iron business with success, requires large investment of capital, and the employment of numerous operatives. When the demand is good, and prices [Illegible Text] it makes rapidly; but when reverses come, nothing but the [Illegible Text] backing can withstand the shock, and one reverse tide will sweep away the labors of years. Hence it is, that in all countries, the Iron business has claimed and received the fostering hand of government to sustain it. Looking to the vast interest Georgia has in the full and proper development of this department of her natural wealth, and not [Illegible Text] sight of the intricate connection it has with the fullest success of her great line of Railroad, your Committee would be tempted, but for the

precedents, to recommend the adoption of some measure for the direct and substantial aid of [Illegible Text] who are now struggling to build up the Iron interest in Georgia. This, however, they do not ask, but simply appeal to [Illegible Text] to give them the preference, all things being [Illegible Text] over foreign competition, so far as we, as a State, have patronage to be show.

The Memorial of the State of Georgia, in behalf of herself and her sister State of Alabama, most respectfully represents to your honorable bodies, that in the year eighteen hundred and thirty-four, the government of the United States advertized and offered for sale at public [Illegible Text], that portion of the public domain in the State of Alabama, known as the Creek nation. This territory had been [Illegible Text] to the United States, by treaties ratified April the twenty-second, eighteen hundred and twenty-six, and April the twelveth, eighteen hundred and thirty-four, made with the Creek tribe of Indians, the whole of which was offered for sale to the highest bidder as aforesaid in eighteen hundred and thirty-four, except the

portion covered by Indian reservations. The treaty of eighteen hundred and thirty-four [Illegible Text] the Creeks to [Illegible Text] their reservations, under the [Illegible Text] and direction of the [Illegible Text] States, which was [Illegible Text] effected in the latter part of the year eighteen hundred and thirty-four, under the supervision of the [Illegible Text] of the government; it was in this way that [Illegible Text] lands in the Creek nation were occupied by the whites, and thus for the first time in the history of the country, the white man by the policy of the government, was settled among the Indians. <sidenote>[Illegible Text].</sidenote></p><p>SEC. II. The citizens thus domesticated with the red man [Illegible Text] a [Illegible Text] in their [Illegible Text] with the Indian, truly commendable, and had no direct instrumentality in promoting the [Illegible Text] that [Illegible Text] out early in May, eighteen hundred and thirty-six, by which out-break, several of the most valuable citizens of Georgia and Alabama lost their lives, and many [Illegible Text] property: this sudden [Illegible Text] by a lawless band of [Illegible Text] upon the lives and property of the whites, was [Illegible Text] the control of the [Illegible Text], the government alone could have prevented it by taking the [Illegible Text] steps at an [Illegible Text] period to move the tribe to its destined home beyond the Mississippi.</p><p>SEC. III. The Creek Indians, by the policy of the government, anterior to the [Illegible Text] in May, eighteen hundred and thirty-six, had become landless, they had planted no crops, game was destroyed, and they had no means, whatever, of subsistence. In this desperate condition they were [Illegible Text] to kill the [Illegible Text] and other stock of the whites, for support, which, with a few [Illegible Text] was submitted to by the [Illegible Text] without [Illegible Text] or [Illegible Text], as their [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] upon [Illegible Text]. Mr. A. [Illegible Text], a Government Commissioner, appointed by the President to investigate the causes that led to the Indian [Illegible Text] in eighteen hundred and thirty-six, reported that in the latter part of the year eighteen hundred and thirty-four, the [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] for want of food; that in eighteen hundred and thirty-five they were reduced to a state little short of [Illegible Text], but he said [Illegible Text] was contrary to [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] of the government to supply them with food, as this act [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] would have [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text]. See [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] Second [Illegible Text], Twenty-Fourth Congress, No. [Illegible Text], page 157.</p><p>SEC. IV. This mistaken policy of the Government, [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] them into [Illegible Text] if such was the design, was the primary cause that led to [Illegible Text], the loss of life and the [Illegible Text] of the property of her citizens, for which your Memorialist now ask indemnity, notwithstanding the

<page id="GA1851.1.P554" no="GA1851.1.553" />

frequent communications of the [Illegible Text] of Georgia and Alabama, besides many highly respectable citizens residing in the Creek nation, to the Secretary of War, advising the Government of the unsettled and [Illegible Text] condition of the Creek [Illegible Text] of Indians, and a strong probability of hostilities. Their request for military aid to keep the Indians in subjection was not granted. See [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text]., Seventh Vol., Second Session, Twenty [Illegible Text] Congress, No. 276.</p><p>SEC. V. At the commencement of the outbreak, those citizens of Alabama and Georgia residing in the nation and in the vicinity of the nation, who escaped the assaults of the hostile Creeks, were compelled to [Illegible Text] from their homes in haste, to place their families in security out of the nation and its vicinity, leaving their property behind, which was either destroyed by the [Illegible Text] or used by the United States troops and friendly Indians; the supplies thus furnished from the [Illegible Text], meat-houses, barns, cattle, and other stock of the citizens of Alabama and Georgia, residing in the Creek nation and vicinity, were absolutely necessary to support the troops of the government and friendly Indians that rallied to the [Illegible Text] until the Government could turnish the needful provisions for the army, besides hundreds of cattle and other stock were shot down by the friendly Indians under the command of General [Illegible Text] to prevent their falling into the hands of the hostile Indians. See letter of [Illegible Text] D. H. Lewis, the petition of [Illegible Text], Bennett, and others; letter and [Illegible Text] of Col. John B. Hogan, United States Emigrating Agent; letter of Gen. Thomas J. Woodward; J. B. [Illegible Text]; Col. Charles McLamore, and other gentlemen of equal standing and respectability. Ex. Doc., Second Session, Twenty-Fifth Congress, No. 127.</p><p>SEC. VI. Your Memorialist would further represent to your honorable bodies, that President Jackson in his Annual Message, December, eighteen hundred and thirty six, brought the subject of losses of the citizens of Georgia, Alabama and Florida, to the consideration of Congress, and recommended an appropriation for their [Illegible Text]. In [Illegible Text] of this [Illegible Text] recommendation, Congress authorized the President to appoint a Board of Commissioners, to investigate and report the amount of the loss [Illegible Text] by Indian depredations in said States. [Illegible Text]. T. Pease, J. M. Smith and Mr. Gibson, constituted said Commission, and after the necessary investigation in Georgia and Alabama, they rendered their report to the Honorable J. R. Poinsett, Secretary of War, twenty-eighth of November,

<page id="GA1851.1.P555" no="GA1851.1.554" />

eighteen hundred and thirty-seven. The amount claimed and proven by the sufferers in said States, they report to be One Million Two Hundred and Fifty-Seven Thousand Four Hundred and Seven Dollars and Thirty Cents, out of which amount they allowed Three Hundred and Fifty-Five Thousand Seven Hundred and Ninety-Seven Dollars and Ninety-Two Cents; this last sum was for real and [Illegible Text] loss. Said Commissioners refused to allow anything for consequental and resulting damage, though it seems to your Memorialist that to do so would be but an act of even handed justice, but the Government has not paid to this date either the actual loss for provisions, c., or the resulting damage.</p><p>SEC. VII. Your Memorialist has been informed and believes, that Congress, by special enactment heretofore, has [Illegible Text] Generals Clinch and Hernandez, and other citizens of Florida and Georgia, not only for real, but resulting damage, likewise; there can be no difference in the losses sustained by these gentlemen, and the claimants of Georgia and Alabama, now knocking at the doors of Congress for justice; it was not the fault of the settler who resided on the lands purehased from the United States and the Creek Indians, in good faith, that hostilities occurred. No act on their part could have [Illegible Text] against it; if there was error it was on the part of the Government in failing to make in time, the necessary arrangements to emigrate the Creeksalways a restless and discontented tribeat an early period, to have supplied them with food while preparing for emigration, and to have kept in the nation a sufficient military force to have awed them into subjection. If this had been done on the part of the Government. [Illegible Text] Memorialist, in behalf of her citizens, and those of [Illegible Text], would not feel constrained to ask Congress to audit and settle the account of her citizens, and those of Alabama, without further delay.</p><p>SEC. VIII. Your Memorialist would further most respecfully represent to your honorable bodies, that the Legislature of Alabama, at its regular session in eighteen hundred and thirty-six and eighteen hundred and thirty-seven, by its Memorial, asked the Government to grant indemnity for the loss sustained by her citizens during the Indian hostilities of eighteen hundred and thirty-six and eighteen hundred and thirty-seven; this Memorial was referred to the Committee on Claims of the House of Representatives, and a report was rendered thereon, fifteenth of May, eighteen hundred and thirty-eight. In July, thereafter, said Committee made a second report, more in <i>[Illegible Text],</i> which

<page id="GA1851.1.P556" no="GA1851.1.555" />

assumed the grounds that that portion of the demand of the citizens of Georgia and Alabama, for destruction of their property by the Creek aggressions, should not be paid by the United States, as it was not the policy of the Government to pay for property lost during a state of war, unless the demands come within the rules established by the law of the United States, approved ninth of April, eighteen hundred and sixteen; the other branch of the claim, asking pay for property used to supply the Government troops and friendly Indians with provisions and forage, c., the Committee admitted, and reported a Bill for the payment of the same, and recommended its passage; but as this occurred near the close of the session of eighteen hundred and thirty-eight, the Bill did not [Illegible Text] a law for the want of time.</p><p>SEC. IX. The grounds assumed by the Committee on Claims, in rejecting the first branch of the account of the citizens of Georgia and Alabama, who sustained loss as aforesaid, however correct when properly applied, cannot [Illegible Text] the slightest influence against the payment of the demand of the claimants in this application; the facts will not sustain the Committee in its conclusions, in the Report referred to. The main objection to indemnity rests on the plea that the depredations being committed, during a state of actual war, it was not in accordance with the policy of the Government to indemnify the sufferers; the Report of the Commissioners, as aforesaid, upon which it is presumed the Committee came to the conclusion that the losses sustained occurred during a state of actual war, is incorrect, as will appear from the following facts:</p><p>SEC. X. The Indian outbreak occurred the second day of May, eighteen hundred and thirty-six, and resulted in the death of  Flournoy, and others; this was the commencement of hostilities in eighteen hundred and thirty-six. The Government of the United States took the census of the Creek nation, thirteenth day of May, eighteen hundred and thirty-three, which exhibits the fact that the whole number of souls of the Creek tribe, exclusive of negroes, was twenty-one thousand seven hundred and sixty-two; of this aggregate, the lower Crecks numbered only eight thousand five hundred and twenty-two, exclusive of negroes, and it was this portion of the nation that resorted to hostilities; the counties of Benton, Taladega, Randolph, Talapoosa, and Chambers, were the homes of the upper Creeks, who did not embark in the outbreak. See statement of Elbert Harris, Commissioner

<page id="GA1851.1.P557" no="GA1851.1.556" />

of Indian Affairs. Ex. Doc. Seventh Vol. First Session, Twenty-Fourth [Illegible Text], No. 276.</p><p>SEC. XI. The lapse of three years, from the taking of the [Illegible Text] to the [Illegible Text] of hostilities, could not add any large number to the [Illegible Text]; there were less than three thousand warriors in the whole nation, and the upper Creeks, the most [Illegible Text] part, did not engage in the outbreak: [Illegible Text]. John B. Hogan, Emigrating Agent, as aforesaid, by [Illegible Text], declares that at the request of Governor Clay, of Alabama, and General Jessup, of the Unitey States Army, he raised from thirteen hundred to fifteen hundred [Illegible Text] warriors, under the Chief Opoth-le-yo-hola; that five or six hundred more were raised under Jim-Boy and placed under the command of General Thomas J. Woodward, these [Illegible Text] constituted the bulk of the warriors of the Creek nation.</p><p>SEC. XII. The Creek and Clerokee delegations to Washington City, in their Joint Memorial to the Congress of the United States, in eighteen hundred and fifty, in protesting against the Bill which had passed the Senate, making the [Illegible Text] of the Creek nation bound for the destruction of the property of the [Illegible Text] of Alabama, Georgia and Florida, in the outbreak of eighteen hundred and thirty-six, [Illegible Text], that notwithstanding these [Illegible Text] and wrongs, <i>[Illegible Text] of the [Illegible Text]</i> (Creek nation) <i>[Illegible Text] friendly, and [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] with the [Illegible Text] of the United States, in suppressing [Illegible Text] and continuance with them, until the [Illegible Text] of those who were hostile [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text],</i> but the muster-rolls on file in the War [Illegible Text] will give the [Illegible Text] number of warriors enrolled, to which your honorable bodies have free access, and the undersigned in behalf of the citizens of Georgia and Alabama, who sustained loss, invite the most rigid [Illegible Text]. Your Memorialist concurs most fully with said delegation, that not more than one-fifth of the warriors of the Creek nation were engaged in the [Illegible Text] of eighteen hundred and thirty-six, and deny that the contrary can be made to appear from any reliable source; your [Illegible Text] bodies are most respectfully asked to [Illegible Text] these factsthey are conclusive that a majority of the Creek nation were not hostile in eighteen hundred [Illegible Text] thirty-six, and eighteen hundred and thirty-seven, and that the damage and loss sustained by the [Illegible Text] in Georgia and [Illegible Text], in the destruction of their [Illegible Text], did not result from a state of actual war, as averred by the Committee, but from the aggressions of a [Illegible Text] of the warriors of the nation, who acted without authority from the Council of the nation, the only compotent

<page id="GA1851.1.P558" no="GA1851.1.557" />

tribunal to declare war. If these are the facts, then it is obvious that the Committee on Claims in their Report [Illegible Text] from incorrect data in rejecting the claims of the [Illegible Text] in Georgia and Alabama; the law of eighteen hundred and sixteen has no just application to this demand the property of the citizen was not destroyed by a foreign enemy, and during a state of actual war; but a sudden outbreak, beyond the control of the citizens or the Council of Creek nation, the government alone had the power to guard against the assaults of this small, but lawless band of desperados, and having failed to do so, is alone responsible for the consequences; a small military force would have been sufficient to have kept the nation quiet, and this force was invoked by the Executive officers of Alabama and Georgia, in vain for years before this outbreak; the citizens of Alabama and Georgia, occupied the country as landholders, having purchased their lands of the Government and the Indians, they were not intruders; the claimants then rely with the greatest confidence for redress, upon the intereourse Act, approved June thirtieth, eighteen hundred and thirty-four. See United States Laws, Twenty-Third Vol., Page 114.</p><p>SEC. XIII. At an early period after hostilities ceased, your Memorialist brought to the consideration of Congress the loss sustained by her citizens; there has been no [Illegible Text] on the part of the claimantstheir demand has been prosecuted against the Government, with due diligence, but in vain; the claimants had no authority or power to demand and receive restitution, either from the Creek nation or the troops in the service of the United States; there was no legal tribunal in which the claimants could have coerced the payment of their demands, either against the one or the other, though they are gravely told by the Report of the Committee, that they must look to the troops in the service of the United States, and the Indians, for pay; but the Committee did not indicate the <i>[Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text],</i> by which this could be effected; whether this was designed to add insult to injury, is left for the consideration of your honorable bodies, and further comment is unnecessary.</p><p>SEC. XIV. The Government, in the removal of the Creek Indians to the country assigned them, beyond the Mississippi, <i>with the full knowledge of all the facts and losses sustained by the [Illegible Text], demanded no [Illegible Text] in their behalf,</i> and having failed to do so by the inter course law of eighteen hundred and thirty-four, must be responsible to the sufferers, or there would be a great wrong

<page id="GA1851.1.P559" no="GA1851.1.558" />

without a remedy; a fair construction of the Act referred to, gives the claimant a legitimate and equitable demand against the Government, [Illegible Text] only for actual, but likewise for constructive or resulting damage.</p><p>SEC. XV. The amount of the claim in the aggregate due the claimants in Georgia and Alabama, cannot effect its legality and equity in the slightest degree; and if the sum total involved should be the means to illicit the most rigid investigation on the part of Congress, your Memorialist will have the most abiding confidence in its payment. Investigation must result in the full liquidation of the demand, unless Congress should depart from all the the rules of law and equity, that have heretofore governed its actions in the final adjustment of Claims against the Government. If it were even true, that the loss of the claimants occurred during a state of war with the Creek tribe of Indians, yet the rule resulting from the Act of eighteen hundred and sixteen could not, in justice, be applied to the settlement of the present demand; there is a vast difference between a war with Great Britain and a war with the Creek tribe of Indians; the law of eighteen hundred and sixteen, under which the Committee on Claims rejected a part of the claim, was enacted a short time after the close of the war with England, and was designed by Congress to govern the settlement of those demands that originated during that war; the one was a powerful foreign enemy and governing their hostilities by the usages of civilized warfare, the other a tributary people, wholly under the control and power of the United States, and governed by rules of warfare peculiar to the savage. This tribe, from the first treaty with the United States, in August, seventeen hundred and ninety, down to the last treaty in eighteen hundred and thirty-three, ever acknowledged its dependence upon the Government; the United States by a small military force, could and ought to have kept the tribe at peace, besides, the Creek nation was [Illegible Text] weak at the time of the outbreak to give rise to the application of the principle, that the Government cannot be expected to protect its citizens from losses resulting from an actual state of war; this resulted from the law of eighteen hundred and sixteen, and so far as a civilized enemy is concerned, is reasonable, for it is contrary to the usages of civilized warfare to destroy private property, unless occupied by the enemywith the savage foe, it is otherwiseit is their habit to destroy everything that is destructable upon which they can lay their hands, as well the property in possession of the government

<page id="GA1851.1.P560" no="GA1851.1.559" />

troops, as the private cabin of the settler; indeed, the private dwelling of the citizen, unprotected by a sufficient force, is the first doomed to the [Illegible Text] and destruction.
