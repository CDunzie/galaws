But as such precise information cannot cannot be had during the session of the Legislature, in time to be acted on, and it is now known, that some of the States will receive their respective proportions of the

<page id="GA1836.1.P296" no="GA1836.1.20" />

said surplus revenue on the terms offered; and others may also receive their proportions, and if this State should refuse to receive her proportion, the public benefits and burdens now operating most unequally, would be increased to a very considerable extent.

Your committee believe that new articles of commerce will be developed for the employment and enriching our citizens.</p><p>The extensive Mining region of the Western portion of our State, known as they are, to contain extensive and rich deposites of gold and other important metals, furnish strong incentives to this undertaking; that our citizens may not waste their resources in irregular and unscientific experiment, much may be done by the employment of one suitable and scientific individual, or more, who shall furnish such facts, and lay down such principles, as will enable them to direct their capital and enterprise, with greater security against losses and disappointments, so well calculated to check the spirit of enterprise.</p><p>Intimately connected with this subject, is the great interests of internal improvement, whether by means of our navigable rivers or inlets, or by means of rail roads. The streams of the State with their extent and capabilities of navigation, the ridges, mountains and general [fertility] of the country, with its capacity for agriculture and commerce; it is high time that Georgia with all her treasures, in money and resources, should forgetting party bickering and strife, make an effort to raise herself to that exalted station among her sister States, to which she is entitled, by the extent and fertility of her territory, the ample resources of Commercial and Agricultural enterprise, her favorable location in reference to the other States, and the energy and intelligence of her citizens. Your committee therefore, beg leave to report the following resolutions:</p><p><i>Resolved</i>, That his Excellency the <i>Governor</i>, or his successor in office, be, and he is hereby authorised to employ, as soon as convenient, one or more suitable and well qualified persons to undertake the work, of a careful and scientific

Prince, Esq. concerning a second edition of the Digest of the Laws of Georgia; have had the subject under consideration, and beg leave to report:</p>

<page id="GA1836.1.P301" no="GA1836.1.25" />

<p>The first edition of that work was compiled in conformity with an act of the General, passed in 1819, and was reported to the Governor in November, 1821, for examination by a committee. It was executed with a degree of care and fidelity, which has rendered it a work of very general usefulness. A number then supposed to be sufficient for public purposes, was taken by the government, but the supply was exhausted in 1831, and more were purchased in 1832, which are also nearly gone, there being in the State House now, about two hundred, and none to be procured elsewhere.</p><p>The manuscript of this second edition is offered by the same editor, and upon the same plan as the former. He states that the old Digest has been thoroughly revised, leaving out the acts that have been since repealed, or that have become obsolete, inserting the subsequent Statutes in their proper places, so that the Volume will exhibit all the public Laws of force, from the earliest period of our Legislature, down to the date of its publication. To this is added, a Synopsis of all the local acts and resolutions, in which are brought together those concerning each county, so as to exhibit in one view, and in order of time, all those that relate to the same subject, with the date of each, and a reference to its Volume and page. The convenience and usefulness of the former edition, while it lasted, has been generally felt. Seventeen years of legislation, has however, produced so many new acts, and such a variety of repeals and amendments of the old, that a new edition would seem to be called for, even if the former was not out of print; and the present time is particularly appropriate, for the further reason, that if the acts of the present session are included, the Volume will contain the important amendments of our Judicial system, which are now in contemplation.</p><p>The committee have, therefore, no hesitation in saying, that the acts of the present session should be included, and they recommend, that the manuscript be then examined by a committee to be appointed for the purpose, and that upon their favorable report, the Governor be directed to take a sufficient number to supply the public officers now, and such as may probably be wanted in future. The Volume if printed as proposed, in the same manner as the former, is estimated to be something more than once and a half as large. The price allowed for those last purchased, was four dollars per

<page id="GA1836.1.P302" no="GA1836.1.26" />

Volume, which would seem to indicate a sum rather above six dollars, as the proportional price, but as the expense of binding is not enhanced in the same proportion as the size of the Volume, the committee think that five dollars and fifty cents, may be considered as a reasonable price. We are not exactly advised of the whole number heretofore taken by the State originally, and by after purchases, but from the best information we can obtain, it would appear that the number was some little short of four thousand. This point, however, is not considered of importance, as that matter should now be governed by existing circumstances.</p><p>Since the publication of the first edition, many new counties have been supplied, but no distinction being now to be made, the new edition, will of course, be sent to the new as well as the old counties, and after they are equally supplied, a proper number, we would say, eight hundred, should be in reserve for further supplies as wanted. The committee, on the whole, would recommend the adoption of the following resolution:</p><p><i>Resolved</i>, That as soon as the acts of the present session shall have been incorporated as proposed, his Excellency the Governor is requested to appoint a committee of three competent persons, to examine the said manuscript, and that if they report their approbation of the same, and that in their opinion, the Volume from the quantity of necessary matter contained therein, will be as large as the foregoing estimate he is directed to take for the public use, at a price not exceeding five dollars per Volume, a sufficient number of bound copies, to furnish one to each of the civil officers of the State, as directed at the last session in the distribution of the Georgia Justice, and also, eight hundred copies for future distribution, and that he pay for the same out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated.</p><p>In the House of Representatives, agreed to, 28th Nov. 1836.</p><p>JOSEPH DAY,</p><p>Speaker of tho House of Representatives.</p><p>AttestJoseph Sturgis, Clerk.</p><p>In Senate, concurred in, 29th Nov. 1836.</p><p>ROBERT M.

<p>That from every view which your committee have been able to give the subject, they are of opinion, that the prayer of the petitioners is reasonable and ought to be granted. Believing that private individual property ought not to be taken for public use, or destroyed for offences committed against the State, without satisfaction being made to such injured individual, unless public justice should so require it. In this case, an offence had been committed against the peace and tranquility of the State, and public justice cried aloud for retributive justice; suspicion fell upon the negro man, Harry, the property of Charlotte Harrison, he was taken and was indicted at the instance of the State; tried, convicted and was executed, under said indictment; though many thought at the time he was innocent, and strong suspicions rested upon a negro man Charles, then the property of John Dumas, who has since died, and the negro man Charles became the property of his widow, Matilda Dumas. The negro man Charles, finding that by his artifice and ingenuity, he had escaped the punishment he then merited, became more emboldened, and did some time in October last, absolutely commit a rape upon a free white female of the county of JonesHere was no suspicionhere was no doubtevery prejudice was removed, by the free, open and public confessions of the negro man Charles, after his apprehension, and both before and after his conviction, and before his execution; he openly and publicly declared, that he did commit the offence of which he was charged; and also, that he was guilty of the offence of attempting to commit a rape on a free white female, for which Harry was hanged, and that he ought to have been hung instead of Harry, upon which said confessions of Harry having committed the rape, he was convicted, as the principal witness in the case was not sworn upon the trial,  no other testimony than the confessions of Charles, were given in upon the trial. Inasmuch as the confessions of Charles was sufficient to insure his own conviction, and taking the whole of his confessions together, for if believed in the one case, it ought to be taken as true in the other, will most fully and clearly show that he was guilty of the offence for which Harry was hanged, and ought to have been hanged in his stead; all of which go clearly to shew that Harry was hanged innocently, and for an offence of which Charles was guilty.</p>

That subsequently an application was made for an additional loan, which eventuated in the further advance of $44,000, or rather, in the subscription for stock to that amountThat after this, the State changed the nature of its institution, and became a stockholder in said company, to the extent of $98,500. and individual subscription to the amount of $99,400, was paid in, and the Canal was opened to the Ogechee river. This Canal, so long as there was a prospect of continuing it to the Alatamaha river, promised well, but Commercial embarrassments, or other causes prevented the subscription money for the extension of it, and for years past, the Canal has not only paid no dividend to the stockholders, but the income from it has not equalled its current expenses, and a debt of several thousand dollars has been incurred; for a part of which, judgment has been obtained, and the Canal is now actually under levy, to satisfy that judgment.</p>

<page id="GA1836.1.P315" no="GA1836.1.39" />

<p>The memorialists manifest a continued disposition on their part, to make this work available, and they represent that the expenditure of about the sum of $100,000, will do so; if at the same time, an arrangement be made, which will induce others to embark in it, and extend it to the Alatamaha river. The questions which occur, are1st. Shall the State further lend its aid to the accomplishment of the scheme, or shall it suffer a sale under the judgment, by which the whole investment will be lostor, shall it sell its interest in the Canal for a price which it may be made to command, giving a sum, under which, it shall not be soldor, should it reduce the rate of its stock in the same same ratio, that individual stockholders will agree to do, and admit a further subscription to defray the expenditures now incurring.</p><p>This committee has had those several propositions under consideration, and most decidedly report against the investment of any more money by the State in this schemeand are as decided in the opinion, that the matter should not remain in its present condition, which is tantamount to the total loss of what has been expended by the State, as well as individuals, and that if individuals are willing still to pursue the enterprise, the State should not withhold its assent. Two modes are suggested by which the State's concurrence will forward the views of the stockholders.</p><p>The one is, that the State shall sell out its interest, for what it shall bringthe other is, that the stock of the State be reduced to ten cents on the dollar, the other stockholders consenting to the same reduction, and amending the act of incorporation, so as to authorise a new subscription of an amount sufficient to make it available. The committee think that the adoption of either proposition will benefit the State, or rather enable her to derive something from that which is now worthless.</p><p>The committee reports herewith, a bill, and recommends the adoption of the following resolution:</p><p><i>Resolved</i>, That the interest of the State in the Savannah, Ogechee and Alatamaha Canal, be sold at private sale, to the best advantage; provided the same be not sold for a less sum than $10,000, to be paid into the Treasury of this State, on or before the first day of June next.</p><p><i>Resolved</i>, That on the payment of the purchase money therefor, all the right, title and interest of the State of Georgia,
