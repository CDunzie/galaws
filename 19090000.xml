<page id="GA1909.1.P1569" no="GA1909.1.1577" />

has inspired our people with a confident hope that their Section will no longer be treated as a conquered province. They accept these cordial expressions of the President as manifestations of real kindliness of heart, and a fervent resolve on his part to adhere to the moral precept he that ruleth over men must be just. In order that no grounds for such feeling may longer exist, the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of Georgia, submits to the President and Secretary of State the following as worthy of thoughtful reflections: <sidenote>The South's representation in consular service of the United States.</sidenote></p><p>First. The cotton production of the South has for more than forty years been potent in giving to this country the balance of trade, being the greatest export money crop of the United States, while the cotton mill industry of the South will unparalleled growth, bids fair to consume, at no distant day, the bulk of the cotton crop.</p><p>Second. That for political considerations the President is not expected to appoint Southern Democrats to fill the higher positions of envoys extraordinary and the ministers plenipotentiary to foreign nations, but the appointment of consuls to reside in a foreign country as the representatives of this country's commercial interests, is not political and these it would seem should be selected without regard to political affiliations, and that we as a matter of right are entitled to just and equal representation in the appointment of these officers.</p><p>Third. It stands to reason that consuls selected from the South, would feel a keener interest in Southern commerce in extending her markets for cotton and cotton goods into foreign countries thereby enhancing home prices, than if chosen from States having their own

<page id="GA1909.1.P1570" no="GA1909.1.1578" />

local interests to subserve and who are strangers to our burdens.</p><p>Fourth. That the present consular service of the United States as corrected and published on June 9th, 1909, by the department of State shows a very great discrimination against the South and especially the cotton growing States in the appointment of these commercial agents, as for instance, forty-five appointments appear from the single State of Ohio, ninety-seven from the State of New York, while the combined cotton States, Georgia, Alabama, Texas, South Carolina, North Carolina, Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi have only forty-two, and of these none are sent to China, Japan or other countries where the prospects of our cotton and cotton goods are of the most inviting character. The cotton States appeal to the President and Secretary of State in so far as may be in their power to correct this discrimination in order that more consuls may be selected from our midst and a greater demand for the cotton output created.</p><p>Resolved, therefore, That the Governor of this State be requested to sign and certify this resolution and statement of facts and forward the same to President W. H. Taft and Secretary of State, P. C. Knox.</p><approvaldate>Approved July 19, 1909.</approvaldate></law>
