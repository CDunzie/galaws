The period has long passed by for examining into the policy that has hitherto been pursued towards these children of the Forest. Nothing is now left, but to devise such a system as shall secure to them in future, the <i>greatest possible good.</i> Thus situated, it becomes the duty, as well as the character of the government, to pursue such measures as may lead to their ultimate preservation, in some distant and fertile region and even that against their present pertinacious determination. It is true, that the leaders and councellors of this unfortunate people, have either from ignorance or improper motives, induced them to refuse to negotiate; but the tide of civilization is setting so fast into their country, that they will soon be sensible how impotent is the red-man, when brought in contact with the whites, endued with education, political and moral endowments; the discovery will soon be made, and by it the Cherokees will be led to treat, for their final removal beyond the limits of Georgia. The exertions of the General Government to effect this object, are recognized with the deepest interest. We find the President holding out to them, the most humane and liberal offers, dictated at the same, by the most profound wisdom.</p>

<p>In lieu of their present possession, a territory equally ample, west of the Mississippi and of their own selection, is tendered to them, and <i>inperpetuity</i> to which is superadded the right of <i>self-government:</i> and a guaranted of protection from the hostile intrusion of other tribes. That as soon as circumstances will admit, and with the consent of Congress, they shall have a delegate in that body, but <i>an immediate agent,</i> paid by the United States, shall represent their interests at Washington. That their removal shall be at the expense of the government, and the individual comfort of each shall be provided for, besides subsistance for the whole for a year after their arrival at their new homes. That <i>school houses</i> and <i>churches</i> shall be erected: <i>Teachers, mechanics</i> and <i>materials</i> be found them, and their <i>orphan children</i> provided for, and lastly, their annuities are to be secured in <i>proportion to their cession.</i> This brief outline marks the benign views of the President, and must attract the attention of the humane, the christian and philanthropist; indeed we must all feel a deep interest in that course of policy, which permanently secures a lasting home, to this remnant of a once powerful nation of aborigines: which at the sametime it refutes the calumnies against our country and proves the steady perseverance of our government in the path of justice, humanity and virtue.

This system of Penitentiary discipline and punishment was at first imperfect and was looked upon rather as an experiment which would be likely to eventuate favorably than the settled result of experience. Prison discipline was then but imperfectly understood and the new system was ushered into being, under all the disadvantageous circumstances, which usually attend upon fundamental changes in the administration of either the civil or criminal justice of a country. The penal laws of Georgia were revised,  according to the lights which were then attainable, adapted to the principles of Penitentiary discipline and punishment. That code was of necessity extremely defective, and continues to this day [Illegible Text]

<page id="GA1832.1.P218" no="GA1832.1.219" />

in its definitions and unequal in its punishments. It seems to have been expected that the Penitentiary should at once, fully respond to the hopes of its friendsthat under its benign influence, crimes should decrease in number and enormityreformation should speedily work its curing effect upon the guilty, and that a handsome revenue should directly flow in upon the State, from the operation of the system. These expectations as must have been foreseen, proved but dreams and delusions. And so proved, not from any defect in the principles upon which the system was based, but from its imperfect government, and an utter apathy on the part of the State, to its interests. The Penitentiary reared upon a theory untried in this State, was left to work its way towards perfection, not only without legislative aid, but in the face of the most decided opposition. It was not surprising therefore, that it became unpopular, and by act of the General Assembly passed in eighteen hundred and thirty-one, the system was abolished, and the state found itself under the operation of a code of laws, unsuited to the habits of its people, far behind the intelligence of the day and uncongenial with the free institutions of our country. The change thus effected was too palpable not to be felt; and accordingly the system has been revived. The restoration of the Penitentiary with its inadequate buildings, its weakened resources, its defective organization and its ill adaptation to the code, whose penalties it is designed to execute, will bring back upon the state, a system utterly inadequate to the objects of its institution. No one will therefore deny, the system being restored, the absolute necessity of establishing it upon a broad and durable base, of correcting in it the errors and insufficiencies which experience has developed, and of revising the penal code, at least so far as relates to the punishments which it prescribes. To do all this, the most eminent talents, the most patient investigation, and the amplest leisure is requisite. There is no subject of legislation more difficult than the reorganization of the Penitentiarybut few understand the principles of prison discipline, in such perfection, as to legislate wisely in reference to them. Few are acquainted with the models which our own country affords; or with the imperfections of our own systemWith the time and opportunities for labor and research which any committee of the legislature could claim for itself, little, very little could be accomplished. It would seem wise therefore, to call to the aid of the General Assembly, the talents of some of the state's eminent men, of which it has not a few.</p>

The plan of constructing extensive works of internal improvement by the General Government, promised to answer all their ends. By this means the Treasury was to be emptied; the commerce of the country taxed without limit; the territory and jurisdiction of the states invaded and prostrated. The continued exercise of this power, would have accomplised all their wishesWhile it afforded a pretext for protecting domestic manufactures by high duties to supply the wants of government, it appropriated its revenue to construct roads

<page id="GA1832.1.P256" no="GA1832.1.258" />

other banks, owned by the Central Bank, the notes of that Bank, and the specie in its vaults were all found to agree with the report referred to your committee. The issues of the Bank have been within the limits prescribed by law, the discounts have been properly and proportionally distributed to the several counties of this State, and the sums allowed to individuals have not exceeded the amount authorised by law. The ability, intelligence and industry which have heretofore so eminently characterised the Directors and officers of the institution, your committee take pleasure in stating still continues with unabated zeal and fidelity which is every where so fully manifested in the several departments of the institution, whilst the various, complicated, and often delicate duties of the Central Bank shall continue to be conducted in the same spirit and managed in the same judicious way that has heretofore and still continues to characterise its administration, the public, for whose use it has been established, must feel that much will be done in the collection and securing of the public debts, and the maintainance of a sound currency, at the same time that a large addition will be made to the annual income of the State.</p><p>During the past year the Governor found it necessary in order to progress with the survey of the Cherokee territory as by an act of the last legislature he was directed to do and to defray the current expenses of the government, to call to his aid other means than the Treasury of the State aforesaid [afforded,] this necessity [Illegible Text] out of the madequacy of the funds of that department to meet these disbursements, to provide for the deficiency the Governor applied to the Directors of the Central Bank to advance whatever additional amount might be required. This the Directors consented to do believing that the great interest of which the state had in the immediate survey  occupancy of that territory required them to assume the responsibility of advancing without legislative authority, upon Executive warrants, the sam requisite for this purpose. Your committee feel bound to approve the course pursued by the Directors in [Illegible Text] advancing funds which the Treasury could not supply, and without which the operations of the government must have been greatly embarressed. They advanced the sum of ninety-two thousand, eight hundred and eighty dollars and twenty-nine centsan additional sum of nearly like amount will be necessary to be drawn from the funds of the Central Bank to pay the appropriations which will be necessary to be made by the present Legislature (in addition to the ordinary

<page id="GA1832.1.P257" no="GA1832.1.259" />

receipts of the State) thereby reducing the means of the Central Bank about one hundred and eighty thousand dollars. Your committee feel bound to ask is it the intention of the State to draw annually from the funds of the Central Bank to pay most of the ordinary expenses of the government and thereby destroy its benefits and usefulness to the good people of this State? They cannot but indulge the opinion that a negative answer will be the response. Your committee will further remark, that they have reason to fear that no dividend of loans to the several counties in this State can be made the next Spring as has been usual in consequence of the payments heretofore made, and which will be necessary to pay the appropriations which will be made during the present session of the Legislature. The notes of the Central Bank in circulation amount of $96,704; to meet these there has been provided a fund consisting of $81,959 55 in specie, $49,280 in notes of the United States Bank and its branches, and $91,480 in notes of the State Banks.</p><p>Your committee respectfully recommend to the Legislature to authorise the directors of the Central Bank to appoint another officer in the said Bank, as it is believed that the various and complicated duties necessary in said institution cannot be well discharged by its present officers; if another officer should be appointed prompt and regular attention would be given to the various outstanding debts of the State which are now suffering for the want of that attention.</p><p>Your committee find that there are in the possession of the Central Bank (and others may and doubtless will be returned) a considerable amount of mutilated notes of its own issue which are unfit for circulation, which your committee recommend should be burnt, and for that purpose submit the following resolution.</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That the mutilated notes of the Central Bank which are unfit for circulation now in its possession, or which may hereafter come into its possession shall be burned, and for that purpose it shall de the duty of the Directors to have the same done, and whenever they shall determine to burn any of said mutilated note as aforesaid, they shall pass an order and have the same recorded on the minutes of the Board, directing the Cashier of said Bank to make out and present to them a precise list of such mutilated notes which they may determine to burnand after said Directors shall compare said mutilated notes with the list and shall find the

They are clearly of opinion that the cautious and wise provisions of the late act requiring the immediate record of the names and prizes drawn, as they as drawn, is one of the causes which slightly retards the drawing. The numerous applications to deposite names in the Gold wheel, and for certificates of numbers drawn, may also be classed among the causes; as another cause, (probably the only one which can now be remedied,) your committee report the want of one additional clerk at each wheel, whose duty it shall be to assist in making the proper entries on the county books; (so called,) the time engaged in actual drawing is said by the commissioners, to be tween the hours of nine A. M. and one P. M. while the balance of the day is engaged in entering the names of the fortunate drawers, and the prizes drawn; on the county and numerical books, and in examining and comparing the entries thus made with the tickets drawn; by the addition of one more clerk to each wheel, these entries would be expedited and much less time lost in actual drawing; the commissioners of the land wheel, are of opinion that by the addition of one more clerk, they would be enabled to draw and enter one hundred more tickets in the day; the commissioners at the gold wheel, believe one additional clerk there, would greatly expedite the drawing. Under the act passed the seventh inst. the commissioners by and with the consent of the Governor, have the appointment of all necessary clerks. The Governor under that act having no power to appoint but only to remove for misconduct, c. the community desiring and the policy of the State requiring a speedy termination of said lotteries; your committee would therefore recommend the adoption of the following resolution, viz:</p><p>Whereas, the Land and Gold Lotteries now in operation under the present arrangements, are not progressing in accordance with the general wishes and expectations of the public, and consequently the occupancy of a great part of the Cherokee county must be protracted to a period greatly

In the examination of the matter submitted, the committee find that a fi fa of the description named was placed in the hands of the said Wright Mims while acting as the Sheriff of Wilkinson county; and that in consequence of various fi fas and claims being in the hands of the said Wright Mims at the time against Isaac Hall the defendant, a great deal of litigation and some legislation grew out of it. The defendant on the one hand obtaining indulgence from the State, and payments actually made and the proceeds of property sold, and on the other the Sheriff contending that he had applied said payments to older claimsand that afterwards the said fi fa being lost or mislaid, or burnt with the public records of the countythe Comptroller issued a new execution for the whole amount of said taxthe defendant Isaac Hall then applied to the legislature of relief and by a resolution paper [passed] the said fi fa was ordered to `Surcease,' which was interpreted by the court to discharge the defendant [Illegible Text] from said fi fa.

<p>Upon the first branch of the subject, the committee deem it unnecessary to point out minutely in this report, (because it would swell it to an unusual length,) the numerous violations of the charter. They will simply content themselves by adverting to a few out of many, by way of showing the almost total disregard of the act incorporating the Bank of Macon. This institution was incorporated by an act of the Legislature, in Dec. eighteen hundred  twenty-five, in which the names of <i>nine persons</i> are set forth as Directors, not <i>less than a majority whom</i> shall form a board for the transaction of business. Notwithstanding which at the commencement of their operations, the Board of Directors passed the following rule, which your committee believe is in direct variance with the letter and spirit of the charter, to-wit: That the President and <i>two Directors,</i> be a committee to [Illegible Text] bills. Your committee believe, that discounting of bills was transacting of business as much as the discounting of notes, and required the same number of directors, (to-wit: a majority of the whole board,) to do the one as the other.</p><p>Again, by a resolution on the minutes of the board the <i>Cashier</i> and <i>two Directors</i> were authorised to discount <i>notes</i> and bills.This is too palpable a violation of the charter to require any comment, and yet bills of exchange and notes as appears from the books of the bank, were <i>often</i> discounted by the Cashier and two Directors; so that <i>two Directors</i> out of nine did that which the charter said should only be done by a majority of the Board. But this is not all; one of the Cashiers of the bank Robert Collins, admits that while he acted in that capacity, he <i>frequently</i> discounted bills and paid over the proceeds thereof to the individuals entitled to the same, without the direction of <i>any Board,</i> and the only excuse which he assigns for the same, is, that he afterwards submitted the bills to the Board of Directors for approval, and adds that such was the practice with all the Cashiers in Macon. Thus the whole management of this branch of their business was often committed to the judgment of <i>one individual,</i> and that individual not even a Director of the Bank. Your committee need not say that such a practice in their judgment, is fraught with much danger wherever the same exists. The committee whilst upon this branch of the subject beg leave to state, that so far as their knowledge extends, no such practice has prevailed in any of the regular chartered Banks of the State; and that if it does prevail in any of them, the evil ought forthwith to be corrected by those who have the management thereof. The charter requires,

<page id="GA1832.1.P279" no="GA1832.1.281" />

that the Directors should keep a regular book of minutes. From the evidence it appears, that there was <i>no Board of Directors</i> after the twenty-seventh February last, and yet notes to a large amount were discounted and business generally transacted until the Bank failed, which was on the twenty-eight July last, so last, so that the Bank was in operation five months without any regular Board, and during this period an immense amount of bills were put into circulation, to one individual even as much as $145,773, were entrusted for the purpose of buying gold Bullion, in this and other States. And the reason assigned for such gross neglect of duty is, that Mr. Ellis, (who never was the President of Bank,) said it was not necessary to keep a book of minutes,</p><p>Another of the fundamental rules of the charter is, that the President, Cashier and other officers of the Bank, shall take an oath well and faithfully to discharge the duties of their office, on entering on the same. Your committee were not able to discover from the minutes except in one or two instances, and those in the early stages of their operations, that this provision of the charter had been complied with, in fact they believe it has been entirely disregarded for several years past.</p><p>The debts of individuals and copartnerships by the charter, were not to be extended beyond $10,000, for money loaned, nevertheless in a variety of instances, both the debts of individuals and copartnerships, were extended much beyond this sum, by the discounting of bills of exchange. Many of the former officers of the Bank were examined, to ascertain whether the discounting of bills of exchange for individuals or copartnerships, for a larger amount than $10,000, was considered by the Board a violation of the Charter. It appears from their answers, that bills of exchange and notes were placed upon a different footing. That while the debts of individuals and copartnerships for money loaned, could not be extended beyond $10,000, without a violation of the charter, the same individuals might have bills of exchange discounted for <i>any amount over</i> $10,000, and the charter not be violated. Your committee beg leave to dissent from such a construction of the charter, and believe it not at all in accordance with the true intent and meaning of the Legislature. Its plain and obvious meaning is, that the debt of <i>no individual</i> or <i>copartnership no matter how created,</i> whethen by notes or bills should exceed the sum of $10,000. But in several instances even in regard to <i>notes,</i> they find the charter has been violated, a few of which will be mentioned. A note

<page id="GA1832.1.P280" no="GA1832.1.282" />

of Thomas M. Ellis, for $15,000, was discounted during the time that Robert Collins was Cashier, and on the twenty-eighth day of July last, during the time L. Atkinson was Cashier, and which was the day the Bank failed, Ellis, Shotwell  Co's. notes were discounted <i>without any Board of Directors being present,</i> for the sum of $41,865 48 [Illegible Text] and on the same day Thomas M, Elli's note for $11,229 21, making the enormous sum of $53,094 69, for one copartnership, whereby available assetts to the foregoing amount were withdraw from the Bank, and the paper of a firm which is considered insolvent, substituted therefor. The committee will forbear commenting on this sort of conduct, they believe the community will place a proper estimate upon the motive which induced it.</p><p>The charter requires that <i>none but a stockholder</i> being a citizen of the State of Georgia, shall be eligible as a Director, except on the part of the State. Your committee find that this provision like all the rest, has been violated in several instances, by individuals having been elected and serving as directors; and in one instance, Robert W. Fort was elected, and served as President of the Bank, without owning any stock whatever. By the 11th rule of the charter, no transfers of stock shall be considered as binding upon the company, unless entered on a book or books kept for that purpose by the company, and yet long after all the stock (except that portion reserved for the State) had been taken, certain individuals by the evidence, appear to have become stockholders to whom <i>no transfer</i> of stock appears ever to have been made on the transfer book, and again, these <i>same individuals</i> are said to have sold their stock while the transfer book furnishes <i>no evidence</i> of that fact, nor do their names ever appear on the stock [Illegible Text] as stockholders, but only in the margin of what is called a scrip or certificate book. Some short time previous to the purchase by Robert Collins  Co. from Lamar  Co. about one-third of the stock was transferred to the President, Directors  Co. of the Bank of Macon, and soon after the purchase by Robert Collins  Co. the balance of the stock except ten shares, were in like manner transferred to the President, Directors  Co. of the Bank of Macon, after which time no transfers appear to have been made until the third of February, eighteen hundred and thirty-two, at which time Robert Collins, as Cashier of the Bank of Macon, transferred 1,200 shares to Thomas M. Ellis, and on the seventh of the same month 200 shares more. In addition to which J. Godard  Reed, and Melrose  Kidd, on the twentieth of April, eighteen hundred and thirty-two,

<page id="GA1832.1.P281" no="GA1832.1.283" />

each transferred 100 shares of stock, without ever having been the owners thereof, so far as the transfer book shews.</p><p>Your committee are utterly at a loss how to account for such irregularities in the transfers of the stock of the Bank. They believe the rule above alluded to, to be one of obvious necessity and importance in the charters of all Banks. Without some regular mode of transfering stock on the books of the Bank, the Directors of the Bank would never know who were entitled to vote at elections for officers of the Bank. Another reason which the Legislature had in view in inserting it in the charter, was to prohibit Directors from transferring in a clandestine manner [Illegible Text] stock while indebted to the bank. Your committee propose <i>to notice</i> one more <i>rule</i> of the charter which has been violated, and then close their remarks on this branch of the subject. The charter requires that the total amount of the debts which the Bank shall at any time owe, whether by bond, [Illegible Text] note or other contract, shall not exceed <i>three times</i> the amount of the capital. In regard to this part of the subject, it appears from the books of the Bank, that on the twenty-second December, eighteen hundred and twenty-eight, on a capital of $54,000 paid in, bills amounting $248,922, (namely) five times the amount of the capital were put into circulation, being an excess of $86,922. It is however proper to state, that during the following summer the Bank brought itself within the charter. But then again on the eighth March, eighteen hundred and thirty, upon a capital of $75,000 paid in, bills amounting to $356,292, (nearly five times the amount of its capital,) were again thrown into circulation, being an excess of $131,292. Here it is proper again to state, that the next summer they were reduced to the limit of the charter. From the eighth March, eighteen hundred and thirty, to the twenty-fifth of June, eighteen hundred and thirty-one, the date of the sale from Lamar  Co. to Robert Collins  Co. the circulation was reduced from $356,292, to $165,701. On the first of October, eighteen hundred and thirty-one, the circulation as appears from the report made to the Governor and by him transmitted to the Legislature, was $115,701, after which the books of the Bank do not show the precise amount in circulation. It appears however from the evidence, that on the thirteenth February, eighteen hundred and thirty-two, which was the time Robert Collins  Co. sold out the Bank to Thomas M. Ellis, on a capital of $125,000, bills amounting to $540,921, (nearly <i>five times</i> the amount of the capital) were <i>actually</i> in circulation, after deducting $49,000, which was

<page id="GA1832.1.P282" no="GA1832.1.284" />

then in the vault of the Bank <i>previously prepared</i> for circulation, being an excess of $165,921.</p><p>The committee would here state explicitly, that the several sums named in this branch of their report, are taken from the weekly statements of the Bank, which should always exhibit not only the true amount of notes in circulation but the <i>exact condition</i> of the Bank generally. The number of discrepancies between the several books of the Bank, induced your committee to test the correctness of these weekly statements, in regard to the amount of bills in circulation, by examining what is called a register of notes, in which every bill should be entered as soon as prepared for and before it is put into circulation. In the progress of this examination your committee found some of the entries on the register of Mr. Rea, <i>made in pencil,</i> and upon the examination of witnesses, that at least one omission had been made to register bills amounting to $6,430, by R. Collins, before they had been put into circulation. The register of Mr. Collins, ought not therefore to be relied on as correct.From these two facts your committee feel bound to state, that no greater reliance can be placed on these registers than the other books of the Bank. From these registers however, as will be seen by the first table marked (H) the amount now in circulation is $379,585, being $53,686 50, <i>more than is put down in the weekly statements.</i> Finding so large a difference to exist in the circulation from the examinations thus far, and believing it was a matter of great importance, to ascertain if practicable <i>the true amount</i> of bills <i>now in circulation,</i> your committee proceed by another course of investigation, (which the table marked (I) exhibits) and in which no mistake could likely be made to arrive at this knowledge. They examined each Cashier, as to the amount of bills received from the engravers while he was in office, they had also the accounts of engravers exhibited before them to test the truth of their statements, from which it appeared that bills amounting to $1,285,150, were received from the engravers. From the evidence of James Rea and Robert Collins, bills amounting to $273,307 50 cts. have been cancelled and destroyed. The amount of bills now on hand according to the evidence of L. Atkison, is $558,712 50cts. which added to the amount destroyed makes the sum of $832,020, <i>destroyed and on hand,</i> this amount deducted from $1,285,150, received from the engravers, leaves $453,130, <i>now in circulation,</i> being $127,231 50 cts. <i>more</i> than is put down on the state of the Bank. Your committee cannot perceive how any mistake can exist in this last calrculation. If the witnesses have given the true amount

<page id="GA1832.1.P283" no="GA1832.1.285" />

heretofore destroyed, and of that now on hand; there can be <i>none</i> as to the amount received from the engravers, for the accounts for engraving have been exhibited to the committee.</p><p>The following are the tables referred to. Such a confused state of affairs requires no comment. They hope the tables will in some degree enable the community to <i>conjecture</i> the amount of bills <i>now in</i> circulation. <footnoteref pointer="GA1832.1.F3">*</footnoteref><footnote target="GA1832.1.F3"><p>* Since the Committee had closed the evidence, and just before they were ready to report, a letter from James Rea, appended to this report and marked (K) was received. As it is not the wish of the Committee to do injustice to any one who has been in any way connected with the Bank of Macon, they have concluded to attach it to this report. Giving it then all the force of evidence, as if it had been properly taken and which can be claimed for it, it does not in the <i>slightest degree</i> change the result as set forth in the table marked H. That table it will be perceived is predicated upon the registers of notes prepared for circulation by the Cashiers. It does however change the result in that marked I, but to what extent the Committee cannot determine as the <i>amount</i> said to be destroyed, is not set forth in Mr. Rea's letter.

It appears from the books that the <i>Bank</i> was the owner of the whole capital from the twenty-fourth June, eighteen hundred and thirty-one, until the first of September of the same year. When Robert Coleman and Robert Collins paid into the Bank the sum of $50,000, obtained by the discount of the notes of various individuals, in payment of that portion of stock represented by them, and the balance of the stock was [Illegible Text] on the books as the property of the <i>bank,</i> to the thirteenth of February, eighteen hundred and thirty-two, the date of the sale by Robert Collins to Thomas M. [Illegible Text], after which the bank again appears to have become the owner of all the stock.</p><p>From the foregoing facts, it will be seen that from the twenty-fourth June, eighteen hundred and thirty-one, to the date of the failure, the <i>[Illegible Text]</i> was withdrawn from the Bank, without any thing being substituted therefor, except

the payment made by Robert Coleman and Robert Collins, amounting to $50,000, as before stated, which was paid in the Bank in September, eighteen hundred and thirty-one, and again, withdrawn in February, eighteen hundred and thirty-two, the time that Collins sold out to Ellis. It appears however, from the evidence of L. Atkison, that stock amounting to $25,000 was held by various individuals at the time Ellis purchased the Bank, and which he afterwards bought and paid for <i>out of the [Illegible Text] of the Bank,</i> but of this, the stock ledger furnishes no evidence whatever.</p><p>The second cause [Illegible Text] operated to produce the failure of the Bank was the [Illegible Text] of $25,000 paid by Robert Collins to the original stockholders, and which was paid <i>out of the assets of the Bank.</i> In addition to which there was another premium of $15,000, paid by Thomas M. Ellis to Robert Collins, paid also <i>out of the assets of the Bank.</i></p><p>Another cause which contributed (and that in no small degree) to produce the failure was the creation of bad debts, which amounted according to the testimony of Robert Collins, at the time he became the purchaser, to about $30,000, which [Illegible Text] further increased to about $40,000 when he sold out to Ellis and from the testimony of L. Atkinson, it appears that on the day of the failure the bad and doubtful debts amounted from 130 to $135,000.</p><p>Thus it would seem from the foregoing facts (and there is no [Illegible Text] of the truth of them) that causes ample in their nature had accumulated sufficient to have produced the [Illegible Text] of any bank, much less the Bank of Macon, from which <i>all its capital stock</i> had been withdrawn and nothing substituted thereforIn addition to all which, there is yet another; and that was the great over issues and bad loans in the winter of 1831-2.</p><p>That a Bank <i>without a capital</i> having paid <i>out of its own means</i> $25,000 as a premium to the original stockholders, and having on hand $40,000 in bad debts, should throw into circulation bills to the amount of $540,921, which appears was the fact on the thirteenth February, eighteen hundred and thirty two, when Robert Collins sold out to Ellis, manifests such a total disregard for the losses to which the [Illegible Text] might thereby be subjected (and which the result has proven they have been subjected to) that your committee are at a [Illegible Text] to find terms [Illegible Text] stong to express their reprehension.</p>

<page id="GA1832.1.P286" no="GA1832.1.288" />

<p>Your committee cannot dismiss this part of the subject without adverting to one additional cause, of minor importance it is true, but at same time, which tended to produce the present disastrous state of affairs growing out of the recent failure of the Bank of Macon. It appears from the evidence, that on the sixteenth February, eighteen hundred and thirty-two, Robert Collins as the agent for Robert S. Patton, made a contract with the Bank of Macon, a copy of which is attached to this report, and marked G, whereby the said Bank agreed to furnish and did furnish the said Patton at various times bills of the Bank of Macon, amounting to $145,773, with which the said [Illegible Text] was to purchase gold bullion, and for which the Bank agreed to allow him Patton 98 [Illegible Text]. per Dwt. and not to charge him any interest, the gold to be delivered at the Bank in Macon. It appears from the evidence that $81,884, 10-24 dwts. was received, which at 98 cts. per dwt. the contract price amounts to $80,247, 14-100 cts. which gold was sold for $73,695 97 cts. whereby the Bank sustained a clear loss of $6,551 17. It is however proper to observe, that the 90 cts. per dwt. which the Bank received was an <i>advance</i> of this much, subject to be increased or diminished according to its value at the Mint.</p><p>It now remains to be noticed in what manner this contract <i>was made, with what faith it has been executed,</i> and how far those conterned in it are yet responsible to the Bank or rather the present holders of its bills. The community more or less have been sufferers thereby, and particularly that section of the State where the Macon bills were put off or exchanged for gold bullion.</p><p>It is to your committee a matter of great astonishment, that an agent acting in so delicate and responsible a situation as that in which Robert S. Patton was placed, entrusted by the Bank of Macon with a large amount of money, should not be able to tell <i>what amount of Macon bills he had on hand at the time of its failure, belonging to the Bank of Macon.</i>If his accounts had been honestly and fairly kept between his principal and himself, in relation to this matter, he could have answered this question to the satisfaction of any one, without any kind of difficulty whatever. In the answer of R. S. Patton to the seventh interrogatory, he says, I am not able to state how much, neither do I know how much I had on hand at the time of the failure. The answer itself affords abundant grounds to censure him, either for <i>gross ignorance or gross corruption.</i> Your committee doubt very much whether there is another individual in this State [Illegible Text]

<page id="GA1832.1.P287" no="GA1832.1.289" />

[Illegible Text], who had bills of the Bank of Macon on hand at the date of its failure, but could tell the amount to a [Illegible Text] dollar, and yet Robert S. Patton acting as the agent of a Bank, and to whom had been entrusted a large amount of money, knowing too that he would be called upon at some day, to render an account of his actings and doings in relation to this matter, says that he is not able to say how much. It will be perceived that this information was sought from various individuals and was attended with no better success. The answers of Robert Collins (who was the confidential friend and adviser of Patton, and who stood charged with this balance on the books of the Bank <i>jointly with Patton,</i> and through whose hands a large portion of the money passed for the purpose of being invested in gold,) furnish no satisfactory information upon this pointThey are <i>[Illegible Text]</i> worded and almost every fact of any importance in relation to this matter most <i>industriously</i> concealed. But your committee are of the opinion (and believe they are sustained fully by the testimony) that the whole odium of this most disgraceful transaction should by no means rest upon Robert S. Patton. They believe the <i>way</i> and <i>manner</i> in which this balance was settled, the individuals concerned in that settlement, as well as the <i>time</i> at which it was settled, together with a variety of other circumstances, prove conclusively, that Robert Collins was largely benefitted by this same gold contract, as well as Patton, and that his conduct and [Illegible Text] throughout has very justly placed him in an [Illegible Text] attitude before the community. It is in evidence that Robert Collins [Illegible Text] Giles B. Taylor <i>after the Bank failed</i> and <i>after the [Illegible Text] of Ellis</i> to execute his two notes amounting in the whole to the sum of $54,333 one payable at six, the other at twelve months in the bills of the Bank of Macon to C. B. Cole, Bank attorney in part satisfaction of this balance, and that Collins transferred to Taylor in part consideration therefor, a claim on Ellis, Shotwell  Co. for $9,500, the balance of the consideration which Taylor was to receive for giving his notes, was between 15 and $20,000, in Macon bills, in a further trade as spoken of between Collins and himself, <i>but which has not yet been [Illegible Text].</i> It is not [Illegible Text] that the notes of Giles B. Taylor were given for any thing else but to [Illegible Text] the claim which stood on the books of the Bank against Collins  Patton, and which was $65,525 86. Can any one believe that at the <i>time these notes</i> of Taylor were [Illegible Text] to C. B. Cole, that Collins or Patton had on hand $54,333 in bills of the Bank of Macon. The thing is too absurd and preposterous in itself to be believed by any one.

<page id="GA1832.1.P288" no="GA1832.1.290" />

If they or either of them had this amount in the bills of the Bank of Macon at that time on hand they would have [Illegible Text] it into the Bank or to the Bank attorney, and thereby Robert Collins would have saved $9,500, which he gave to Taylor in the claim on Ellis, Shotwell,  Co. Again, wherefore the necessity of resorting to the aid of Taylor or any one else to assist in settling up this balance If the [Illegible Text] had been an honest one, and notes had been the only thing that was necessary to settle it up, the notes of Robert [Illegible Text] would have been as good or better than the notes of any other individual. Again, why was it necessary that Taylor's notes should bear date in the <i>life time</i> of Ellis, when the contract was <i>both made</i> and <i>consummated after his death</i>(see the evidence of Giles B. Taylor on this point.) It will [Illegible Text] perceived that the obvious course of Robert [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] this whole affair has been to act as much as possible through the instrumentality of others, and thereby [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] securing himself as much as possible from liability. Thus we see him the day after he sold out the Bank to Thomas M. Ellis, making a large and important contract in the name of his brother-in law, Robert S. Patton, writing that contract himself, and then we find him winding up the same contract through the instrumentality of Giles B. Taylor and C. B. Cole; causing the notes that were given in part payment of this balance to be [Illegible Text] If this settlement had been a fair and honest one and made by those who were authorised to make it (neither of which your committee can believe) there would have been no necessity for any such finessing. If the bills had been on hand, they should and would have been paid into Bank if not on hand they must have been invested in gold before that time if the agent had acted in good faith, and had become <i>eo [Illegible Text] the property of the Bank as soon as such investments were made.</i></p><p>Mr. Cole in his evidence states he received the account for this balance after the failure of the Bank, with instructions to present it to Collins for settlement and in case of his refusal to sue him. He says that Collins refused to [Illegible Text] it, denied the justness and correctness of the charges [Illegible Text] contended the account should have been charged to R. [Illegible Text] Patton alone, as the money was advanced to him. And yet strange to tell, Robert Collins after all this, gives Giles B. Taylor the extraordinary sum of $9,500 to aid him in [Illegible Text] this same account so <i>unjust</i> and <i>incorrect</i> and with which he would have the community to believe he had no connection either at the time it was made or at the time it was presented for settlement.</p>

<page id="GA1832.1.P289" no="GA1832.1.291" />

<p>For such extraordinary conduct, Mr. [Illegible Text] either deserves the credit of being one of the most generous and liberal hearted men of the age, or he must [Illegible Text] the [Illegible Text] of having participated in the commission of a [Illegible Text] on the Bank or its creditors. In which character he deserves to stand, the community <i>can</i> and <i>will judge.</i> Thus the circumstances attending the settlement of this balance, fully [Illegible Text] the belief that Collins was [Illegible Text] in and was [Illegible Text] benefited by this gold contract. But if there was any [Illegible Text] upon the subject, the testimoney of Higgins, Cowles, Washburn and [Illegible Text] will put that doubt to rest.</p><p>From all the [Illegible Text] attending this settlement, your committee do not believe that Robert Collins and Robert S. Patton paid on [Illegible Text] thereof in [Illegible Text] of the Bank of [Illegible Text] more than $11,192 86, which sum if subtracted from $65,525 86, <i>the balance against them on the books of the Bank,</i> leaves $54,333, the <i>precise amount</i> for which Taylor's notes were executed to C. B. Cole. The committee are strenthened in this opinion from the evidence of Mr. RatherfordHe is asked what amount of bills of the bank of Macon, Patton had on [Illegible Text] belonging to the bank, at the time of its failure; and he answers that he cannot tell precisely, but it was from 12 to 15 thousand dollars <i>upwards of</i> $11,000 <i>of which</i> was delivered to Collins to be paid into the Bank. If the above reasoning be true, Collins and Patton paid a debt of $65,525 86, with $20,692 86, thereby making $44,833. Your committee before dismissing this branch of the subject beg leave to state that they are by no means satisfied that Collins and Patton stand acquitted and discharged in relation to this balance. It is a question however, of some delieacy and importance, and will no doubt be presented to the judicial tribunals for adjudication. In regard to the present state and condition of the Bank of Macon, your committee would remark, that it appears from the evidence of the late [Illegible Text] Mr. [Illegible Text] that there is <i>now on hand</i> $289,959 82, consisting of demands of various descriptions. Included in this sum, there is probably from 130 to $135,000 of bad and doubtful debts, which will leave a balance of $154,959 82, to redeem a [Illegible Text] agreeably to the <i>state of the Bank,</i> of [Illegible Text] 50, but according to <i>the register of bills,</i> of $379,585, and according to the <i>evidence and accounts of engravers</i> as is [Illegible Text] in table marked (1,) of $453,130Your committee therefore cannot tell precisely the present value of the bills of the Bank of Macon, there being no satisfactory evidence

<page id="GA1832.1.P290" no="GA1832.1.292" />

of the amount <i>now in circulation.</i> Your committee would further state that the sole proprietor of the Bank of Macon has recently departed this life, leaving no representative, nor is it probable his estate will be administered upon; he having as your committee have been informed and believe, died wholly insolvent. As a consequence of this state of affairs some of the debtors of the Bank have refused to pay what is due by them, while others who are willing to pay are deprived of an opportunity of so doing, from the want of a person authorised to receive it.</p><p>It remains for the committee now to notice the fraudulent statements and reports which have at various times been made, by the officers of the Bank of Macon to the Governor, and by him transmitted to the legislature. For the purpose of bringing this branch of the subject more immediately and directly before the Legislature and the community, your committee will here submit the following tables, marked (L.) (M.) the first taken from the cash book of the Bank, the other from the reports made to the Legislature of the <i>same date,</i> with this remark; that the cash book if <i>correctly kept,</i> ought to exhibit the <i>exact amount</i> of cash on hand with the true state of the Bank generally. Consequently the reports made to the Legislature, ought to agree <i>precisely</i> with the cash book in this particular.</p>

In the report to the Governor of the same date, they are put down at $24,366. This report was made to the Governor by John T. Lamar, who was then the President of the Bank. Here then was reported to the Legislature as on hand, $20,063 in bills of the chartered Banks of Georgia, [Illegible Text] than was shewn by the cash book. On the 1st October, 1828, bills of the chartered Banks of this State as appears by the report made to the Legislature were set down at $12,213, the cash book of the same date, states them to be but $6,591 50. On the same day in the <i>report</i> to the

<page id="GA1832.1.P292" no="GA1832.1.294" />

Legislature, the bills of the Bank of the United States are set down at $8,370, the cash book states them to be $4,025. In the report to the Governor 1st October, 1829, notes of the chartered Banks of Georgia are set down at $27,107, the cash book of the same day states them to be but $17,174. In 1830, in the report to the Legislature, the specie is set down at $66,445 42. Cash book of the same day states it to be but $56,445 36. In the report to the Governor on the same day, the notes of the chartered Banks of Georgia and of the Bank of the United States, are set down at $49,187; cash books state them at $31,997. These reports were also made by John T. Lamar. In the report to the Governor on the 1st October 1831, the specie is set down at $52,778 60, the cash book on the same day states it to be $47,723 41. In the cash book of that date, the bills of different Banks, including the Bank of Macon, is set down at [Illegible Text]. The report to the Governor states the bills of Banks other than that of Macon, at $11,497, which deducted from the total amount of bills on hand as stated on the cash book, would leave a balance of $21,523, which must have been in bills of the Bank of Macon. In the weekly statements from the 24th June, 1831, the date of the sale from Lamar  Co. to Collins  Co. until some time after the date of the report to the Legislature, the amount of Macon bills in circulation and prepared for issue, is uniformly set down at $165,701. Now take from this sum of $165,701 the amount on hand when the report was made, which is shewn to have been $21,523, and you have left as the <i>actual circulation</i> on the 1st Oct. 1831, the sum of $144,178; and yet in the report the [Illegible Text] is set down at only $115,701. Again, in the letter of the President of the Bank, Robert Coleman, which accompanied this report, it is stated that $10,000 would cover all the injury sustained by the Bank. The evidence taken by the committee shews that at the date of this same report, there was $30,000 in bad debts due the Bank.</p><p>It seems therefore that if the cash book of the Bank shewed its <i>true state</i> and <i>condition,</i> the reports made to the Governor were fraudulent and incorrect. Your committee deem it unnecessary to [Illegible Text] upon this branch of the subject, it is however one which is fruitful of many remarks. The principal object which your committee had in view in pointing out the foregoing discrepances was to shew how the community have been deceived by them, and what little dependence ought to be placed in them unless verified by the oath of the President or of some officer of the Bank.

your committee might close their report, but inasmuch as some odium and censure have been cast upon Mr. Robert W. Fort, the late President of the Bank, by the communityYour committee as an act of justice toward him, take great pleasure in stating, that so far as they knew or believe, his honesty stands unimpeached in their estimation. That he has been negligent he does not pretend to deny. It is also due Mr. Atkinson to say that his conduct during the period he was in office, so far as your committee know or believe, has been fair and correct.</p><p>Your committee believing that banking institutions have already been multiplied far beyond the [Illegible Text] wants of the people, and [Illegible Text] as the charter of the Bank of Macon has been forfeited on account of said Bank having failed to redeem its notes in specie, and the same being at the present time at a discount of at least 75 per cent.; your committee would recommend the passage of an act to repeal the act incorporating the Bank of Macon.</p><p>Read and agreed to, Dec. 15, 1832.</p><p>ASBURY HULL, Speaker.</p><p>Attest, R.

<div><title>GENERAL REMARKS.<br set="CENTER" /></title><p>The larger amount of loss during the 4th quarter, arises from the difference of the sum received for labor of convicts on the cell, and principally from the large expenditures that had to be incurred, for the purpose of furnishing blankets  winter clothes for the convictsthe former having been all destroved by the fire in May; and the institution being by the same event deprived of the means of manufacturing the latter by its own labour. The deficiency of seasoned raw materials in the waggon and cabinet departments, occasioned by the disaster already referred to, had also, considerable effect in reducing the profit which, in other circumstances would have resulted <i>from</i> the labour of the convicts.</p><imgtable><img src="I18321001" /></imgtable><p>Schedule of documents accompanying the Report of the Inspectors of the Penitentiary for the 4th quarter of the year 1831.</p><p><list><item><p>I.

<div><title><i>Of the New Prison.</i><br set="CENTER" /></title><p>In the month of April of the present year, the new Prison was completed, and the convicts introduced into it. The building is constructed of granite, of excellent quality, in a manner highly creditable to the superintendent and architect employed. The corners, window sills and door posts are of hammered stone, the remainder rough. It is eighty-three feet in length, thirty feet in breadth, and three stories in height, containing seventy-five cells.The cells are five feet by eight, and seven feet pitcharched with brick, plaistered and furnished with flues for ventilation, except the upper range.</p><p>In each cell is a grated window, 18 by 24 inches. The side walls are two feet thick; the end two feet six inches, [Illegible Text] by a neat cornice of brick. A passage ten feet wide runs longitudinally through each story; the lower floor of brick, the second and third of wood.</p><p>A substantial arch is thrown over the passage in the third story which would secure the convicts from injury, even should the roof, which is of wood, be destroyed by fire. The convicts are for the most part gratified by the change; their health has not suffered, and there can be no doubt that from the suspension of vicious intercourse, their moral character will be improved.</p><table><tr align="LEFT" valign="BOTTOM"><td>By a reference to Document (C) accompanying the report for the second quarter, it will be seen that the building has cost for materials including miscelaneous items,</td><td align="RIGHT">$5,586 11</td></tr><tr align="LEFT" valign="BOTTOM"><td>For hired labour including salary of Superintendent,</td><td align="RIGHT">3,706 42</td></tr><tr align="LEFT" valign="BOTTOM"><td>For labour performed by convicts</td><td align="RIGHT">4,149 12</td></tr><tr align="LEFT" valign="BOTTOM"><td>Making the total cost of the building amount to</td><td align="RIGHT">$13,441 65</td></tr></table><p>The expense was considerably augmented by the distruction of materials by the fire, and by unfavourable weather during the winter.

<div><title><b>REPORT OF THE PRINCIPAL KEEPER.</b><br set="CENTER" /></title><p>PENITENTIARY, October 1st 1832.</p><p><i>To the Inspectors of the Penitentiary,</i></p><p>GENTLEMENIn presenting to you and through you to the Legislature, this my first annual report since I have had the honor to preside over the institution, I can say, there is much to encourage the friends of this mode of punishing crime, to perseverance in perfecting the system.</p><p>It is needless fer me to say, that in the construction of the former buildings, where many were thrown necessarily together in the same rooms at night, that little could be accomplished in the way of reformation: but since the new cell building has been completed, and the convicts reduced to solitary confinement at night, encouragement has given to put in requisition those salutary influences which were best calculated to bring the prisoners to sober reflection, repentance of, and abandonment of their past follies; the result so far warrants the belief, that very many of the unfortunate men now within these walls, will be returned to society, orderly, upright, and valuable citizens. Eleven or twelve, in the course of the year have made an open profession of religion, and I am happy to say, that nothing in their subsequent conduct would authorise the opinion, that they are not sincere in their professions. It is also highly gratifying to remark, that a large proportion of the convicts have been brought under a moral influence, by which they are readily induced to conform strictly to what they know to be the established and necessary rules of the prison; and it has been my constant care, that the prisoners should have cause to look upon the principal officers of the institution, as their friends and benefactors, placed over them, not to <i>persecute</i> but to enforce those mild and salutary laws, inflicted as a necessary punishment of these crimes; there are however a few, who reluctantly perform their duty, and would endeavor to persuade themselves that the State is largely indebted to them, for having inflicted an excess of punishment; such feelings evidently result from unchastened and deep human depravity, and with such, prompt and certain punishment for the slightest infraction of the rules or neglect of duty, has been found necessary; corporeal punishment however, has been inflicted but in a solitary instance during the year; the stocks, solitary confinement on bread and water for a short time only, has [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] effectual.</p>

<page id="GA1832.1.P322" no="GA1832.1.325" />

<p>While on this branch of the subject, permit me to draw your attention to the remedial influences of Penitentiary confinement, in arresting the progress of crime in our State, since the institution went into operation; you will observe in document No. 6, accompanying this report, that in the year 1819, 53 prisoners were received,  in 1820, 52. This excess of those two years, may be in <i>part</i> attributable to a revision of our Penitentiary code in 1820; but it will be still observed that there has since been a very considerable dimunition of crime, for in 1839 and 31, it will be seen by the above document, that there was one third less received in prison than most of the former years: this in connexion with the fact, that our population has increased 70 per cent from 1820 to 1831. Thus it appears that crimes punishable by Penitentiary confinement, has lessened one half since the institution went into operation. I would not undertake to say, that there have not been other causes in producing these happy results; the progress of <i>temperance</i> in our State I am sensible has had much influence: yet, it cannot be denied from the facts above, that this system of punishment has had a salutary influence in lessening crimeand thus it would seem, that two important objects have been realized by the system; that of reformation in the most vicious of our citizens, and the greatly lessening of crime in our State.</p><p>The next subject I shall call your attention to, is the fiscal concerns of the institution the present year; although it is gratifying to know, that the institution has under my administration proved a source of revenue to the State, yet I would regret exceedingly that its success or failure in this regard, should be made a test of the utility of the system, or a condition of its continuance. And in order to prevent future disappointment on this subject, I will endeavor to give such light as will direct the public mind to just conclusions on this subject, and here I will premise and endeavor to show, that in the institution's quiting expense or falling short of it, depends entirely on contingent circumstances; in the first place, very much depends on the ability and good conduct of the Principal Keeper, (whoever he may be) to manage the fiscal concerns of such an institution; it is useless to enter into argument to prove this position; 2nd it depends very much on the <i>number</i> of convicts and their <i>skill</i> in mechanicks. The aggregate number of convicts this year has been about 90, the salaries of the officers, pay, clothing and rations of guard, clothing and rations of convicts, amounts to about $9,600, a recurrence to the business of the institution for former years will show, that under the above circumstances the institution has rarely quit expence,  although in nine months

<page id="GA1832.1.P323" no="GA1832.1.326" />

of the present year a clear gain to the State of upwards of $1,400 has been realized, I will take it as a fair data, that with [Illegible Text] convicts and the present number of officers and guard, the institution cannot do more than quit expence; should the number of convicts be reduced to 60, the present number of officers and guard could not be diminished, (this is obvious to those who are familiar with the institution,) and the only curtailment in the expenses of the institution, would be the clothing and rations of 30 men (say $1,200,) hence it is evident under such circumstances the institution would fall far short of quiting expence; on the other hand it is deemed that the officers and guard need not be increased, should the number of convicts be increased to 120 or 125, thus the chance for profit to the State would be greatly augmented, but should it be necessary to procure the services of another Assistant Keeper, when the number should increase to 125, the increase of money earned would be $3,733, while the additional expense would only be $600.</p><p>And lastly, the success of the institution in a pecuniary point of view, depends also very much on the rise and fall of produce, c. thus it will be seen, that the profit or loss to the State in the further operations of the Penitentiary, <i>must depend mainly on existing circumstances.</i></p><p>My remarks on the foregoing subject, have been more to satisfy the enquiring mind, than from a sence of their intrinsic imporance to the institution, as I am confident the system should rest on higher considerations than that of mere profit or loss.</p><p>From the expression of public sentiment through our Grand Juries, and in other ways, there seems to be a strong probability that the Penitentiary system will be revived by our Legislature; if so, there is some important considerations that might be presented to that body in relation to the prosperty of the institution.</p><p>The outer walls are in a state of rapid dilapidation near the top, that part of it being most exposed to the weather, it is also deemed very important that the wall should be raised four feet higher, the facility in sealing the wall in its present condition holds out constant temptation to the convicts to attempt their escape; and it is believed that the large number that have made their escape since the establishment of the institution, may be mainly attributed to the lowness of the outer wall; from the strength of the cell building, the prisoner when confined in that at night, can have little hope of escape, but the probability of success by <i>revolt,</i> and scaling the outer walls is so strong, as constantly to render the safety of the convicts precarious; I would therefore suggest the propriety

<page id="GA1832.1.P324" no="GA1832.1.327" />

of raising the walls; and placing chivauxdefrises at each corner, so as to prevent access to the guard boxes; an estimate of the expense will be seen by reference to document No. <i>5,</i> accompanying this report, and I will observe, that the work can be done almost entirely by the convicts.</p><p>Enlarging the work-shops and so arranging them, as to have the convicts constantly under the eye of some one of the keepers, is indispensably necessary. This can be in a good degree accomplished by adding another story to the long workshop, this work can also be entirely accomplished by the labour of the convicts; an estimate of the expense will also be seen by reference to document No. 5.</p><p>Experience has shewn most clearly, that the law requiring the procurement of raw materials, (such as plank and waggon timber, c.) by public contract, has proved very injurious to the institution; combinations have been formed by the few who have been able to take such large contracts; and the consequence has been, that the institution has paid from 25 to 100 per cent more for many articles than like materials would have cost under other circumstances; again, the institution is much crippled in its business, by the operation of the law preventing a convenient and profitable barter with her numerous customers, many of whom would increase their bills of work, if the opportunity offered of paying their accounts in timber, c. the provision of the law however requiring that none of the officers of the institution should furnish materials, should still be preserved.</p><p>Much injury and inconvenience results to the institution, without any corresponding benefit by the law requiring full and complete quarterly returns; this can only be done by taking a complete inventory of the raw materials on hand, which occupies about ten days at the end of each quarter; consequently, drawing the attention of all the officers of the institution from their ordinary business; leaving the convicts without that constant superintendace which is so necessary, as well as creating a great loss of labor and disappointment to customers. Quarterly reports, if it should be deemed advisable, could still be made, which would show the business of the quarter, except the increase or decrease of Stock.<i>Complete annual</i> reports, it is believed, would be all that is necessary to shew the entire business of the Institution from year to year.From my experience, I would say, that the Institution looses not less than $500 by the time lost in taking quarterly inventories, besides other manifest injuries.</p><p>I would recommend provision by law to prevent convicts after discharge, from settling in Baldwin countyapart from

<page id="GA1832.1.P325" no="GA1832.1.328" />

the consideration of injury resulting to the citizens of this community, by having so many of the vicious of our State concentrated among them; great evils have, and are constantly likely to occur to the institution by the indulgence of such a privilege. There are friendships contracted, alliances, and combinations formed in all prisons, which are hard to eradicate or break; and where persons so intimately acquainted with all the internal arrangements and general condition of the Penitentiary, as are those who have spent many years within its walls, it has been found almost impracticable to prevent their maintaining such intercourse, either directly or indirectly, as to interrupt the regular discipline of the institution, and constantly endanger the safety of the convicts. A bold and efficient aid from without, might be attended without disasterous consequences. I would not be understood as affecting by such a law, those who might be sentenced from Baldwin county.</p><p>In regard to the general condition of the institution, in its fiscal concerns, from estimates made, I am convinced that the business of the Institution will sustain it for the ensueing year, without any appropriation from the State. This however cannot be done, or expected. unless payment is made by the State, for the work done the present year, and what may be hereafter done, by way of improvement within the walls, or for other purposes. It is in vain to tell the superficial observer, that the institution has cleared expense, when the Legislature is making annual appropriations for its support. This seeming anomaly must exist, however, so long as a large portion of labor is spent in rebuilding the edifice, and for other public purposes, without compensation.</p><p>It is therefore recommended, that the Legislature make provission for the payment of what work has been done, and what may be directed to be done for the State hereafter, and thus throw the institution entirely upon its own resources until it may be compelled to ask aid of the State.</p><p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p><p>CHARLES C. MILLS, P. K.</p>
