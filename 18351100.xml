<page id="GA1835.1.P103" no="GA1835.1.106" />

to the westto a country to which other Indian tribes have voluntarily gone, and in which the national character and habits of the Cherokees would remain unchanged. It is assumed with confidence that the great mass of these Indians would long ago have acceded to these humane and benevolent offers, but for the intriguing and selfish motives of their chiefs, in whom, by old custom, they have hitherto confided their destinies. And whereas a crisis has arrived when necessity demands that the past policy of the State, in relation to this tribe of Indians, should be carried out, to wit, securing to these aborigines a distant establishment, where they can enjoy their old and established habits and peculiar modes of government, and thereby keep up their identity as a separate people; to place our citizens in the possession of undisturbed lands, which have long been withheld from them, the occupation and cultivation of which would strengthen the state and add to the sum of human happiness. And whereas recent and melancholy experience has proven beyond doubt that white population, and a dense Indian one, cannot with safety intermingle in the same region of country, especially in the Cherokee counties, in many of which the Indians predominate, whose minds are uninformed or uninfluenced by moral principles, and whose habits and ferocious customs make them insensible to the effects of penal sanctions; thereby placing our citizens, their wives and children, and all that is dear to them, at the mercy of the savage, stimulated by his vindictive passions. And whereas, from a knowledge of the Indian character, and from the present feelings of these Indians, it is confidently believed that the right of occupancy of the lands in their possession should be withdrawn, that it would be a strong inducement to them to treat with the general government and consent to a removal to the west. And whereas the present legislature openly avow that their primary object in the measures intended to be pursued are founded on real humanity to these Indians, and with a view in a distant region to perpetuate them with their old identity of character, under the paternal care of the government of the United States, at the same time frankly disavowing any selfish or sinister motives towards them in their present legislation</p><p>Sec. 1. <i>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of Georgia in General Assembly met, and it is hereby enacted by the authority of the same</i>, That immediately from and after the passage of this act, it shall be the duty of his excellency the Governor, to cause grants to issue for all lots that have been drawn in the

The preservation of this Union is dependent upon a community of sympathy and good feeling among their respective people. Any attempt by a portion of the people of one State to interfere, even indirectly, with the domestic institutions of another, has the inevitable tendency to destroy that feeling. Such an attempt is an insult to the state aggrieved, and the motives which impel it are at entire variance with that fraternal spirit which constitutes the people of these states brethren of one great family. But when such attempt involves the safety of the people of a

<page id="GA1835.1.P294" no="GA1835.1.298" />

state, the robbery of their property, the desecration of their constitutional rights, the violation of their domestic peace, infatuation herself must admit, that such attempt persevered in, will inevitably convert pre-existent good feeling into deadly hostility; the certain consequences of which are a sundered Union, and all the horrors of civil commotion. That such attempt is being at this time made by certain fanatics, by the distribution of pamphlets, prints, circulars, annuals, almanacs, and every species of publication, your committee, with mingled feelings of regret and indignation, believe cannot admit of doubt; yet it is a matter of heartfelt congratulation to the friends of Union, that the general and spontaneous expression of feeling which has burst from the patriotism and intelligence of the North, affords the cheering hope that her people are prepared to frown indignantly upon the first dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest, or to enfeeble the sacred ties which now link together the various parts. But notwithstanding the manifestation of this spirit, the movements of the domestic fanatic and foreign emissary, and the insidious means to which they resort, are fraught with so much peril to ourselves, our families, and our undoubted rights, that stern necessity, and a just regard for the peace and harmony of our country, demand that the people of this State should, in temperate, respectful, but determined language, declare their unalterable determination to protect their domestic institutions and constitutional rights from all interference, direct or indirect, from any and every quarter.</p><p>Upon this point there can be no discussion, no compromise, no doubt. They found their rights upon the guarantees afforded by the constitution of the United States, and if the provisions of that charter are to be sacrificed to the spirit of fanaticism or the impules of a false philanthropy, calamity and ruin will soon overwhelm this now happy confederacy. Impressed with the importance of the duty which devolves upon them at the present crisis, your committee, in addition to a bill in amendment of the laws regulating slaves and free persons of colour within this State, would respectfully submit the following resolutions, with the single remark, that if a rigor heretofore unknown to our domestic legislation be found in the features of the bill they have introduced, it has been forced upon them by the movements of men who, assuming to be the friends, are indeed the most cruel enemies of those whom they have taken under their especial care.</p>

in the appropriation bill: That the president and directors of the Central Bank be, and they are hereby authorized to charge the capital stock of said bank with the sum of forty-two thousand eight hundred dollars, the amount of the Speaker's warrant heretofore paid by them; and that said directors also cause to be paid the President and Speaker's warrants of the present session, and the executive warrants drawn upon the treasurer, whenever the funds in the treasury may be inadequate to meet them, and to charge the same to the capital stock of said bank.</p><table><title><i>State of the Central Bank of Georgia, to December 3d</i>, 1835.<br set="CENTER" /></title><tr align="LEFT" valign="TOP"><td /><td /><td align="RIGHT" /><td align="CENTER">DR.</td></tr><tr align="LEFT" valign="TOP"><td colspan="2">Capital stock,</td><td /><td align="RIGHT" /><td align="RIGHT">$2,591,952 58</td></tr><tr align="LEFT" valign="TOP"><td colspan="2">Interest account,</td><td /><td align="RIGHT" /><td align="RIGHT">51 92</td></tr><tr align="LEFT" valign="TOP"><td colspan="2">Discount on notes,</td><td /><td align="RIGHT" /><td align="RIGHT">1,799 60</td></tr><tr align="LEFT" valign="TOP"><td colspan="2">Discount on bills,</td><td /><td align="RIGHT" /><td align="RIGHT">1,023 33</td></tr><tr align="LEFT" valign="TOP"><td colspan="2">Bank of Columbus,</td><td /><td align="RIGHT" /><td align="RIGHT">538 24</td></tr><tr align="LEFT" valign="TOP"><td colspan="2">At the credit of individuals,</td><td /><td align="RIGHT" /><td align="RIGHT">37,246 51</td></tr><tr align="LEFT" valign="TOP"><td colspan="2">Executive Department,</td><td /><td align="RIGHT" /><td align="RIGHT">43,416 00</td></tr><tr align="LEFT" valign="TOP"><td colspan="2">First emission of Central Bank</td><td /><td align="RIGHT" /><td align="RIGHT" /></tr><tr align="LEFT" valign="TOP"><td>notes,</td><td /><td align="RIGHT">690,000</td><td align="RIGHT" /></tr><tr align="LEFT" valign="TOP"><td /><td>on hand,</td><td align="RIGHT">517,300</td><td align="RIGHT" /></tr><tr align="LEFT" valign="TOP"><td /><td /><td align="RIGHT" /><td align="RIGHT" /></tr><tr align="LEFT" valign="TOP"><td /><td /><td align="RIGHT" /><td align="RIGHT" /></tr><tr align="LEFT" valign="TOP"><td /><td>in circulation,</td><td align="RIGHT" /><td align="RIGHT">172,700 00</td></tr><tr align="LEFT" valign="TOP"><td /><td /><td align="RIGHT" /><td align="RIGHT" /></tr><tr align="LEFT" valign="TOP"><td /><td /><td align="RIGHT" /><td align="RIGHT" /></tr><tr align="LEFT" valign="TOP"><td /><td /><td align="RIGHT" /><td align="RIGHT" /></tr><tr align="LEFT" valign="TOP"><td /><td /><td align="RIGHT" /><td align="RIGHT">$2,848,728 28</td></tr><tr align="LEFT" valign="TOP"><td /><td /><td align="RIGHT" /><td align="RIGHT" /></tr><tr align="LEFT" valign="TOP"><td /><td /><td align="RIGHT" /><td align="CENTER">CR.</td></tr><tr align="LEFT" valign="TOP"><td colspan="2">Bank stock,</td><td /><td align="RIGHT" /><td align="RIGHT">$1,005,000 00</td></tr><tr align="LEFT" valign="TOP"><td colspan="2">Stock in Savannah, O. and A.

The time which is now spent in trying to earn something for themselves would probably be spent in a worse manner. The committee would therefore recommend that the internal police be so altered as to allow the inspectors to determine to what extent this custom shall go, or even to prohibit it entirely if they deem it best. They can see the effect of their regulations and make the necessary alterations. This course will enable the officers to favour those that merit it, which will operate as an incentive to good behaviour. It appears that there is no provision made for furnishing the convicts with hats, and that the clothes at present allowed are not sufficient for that class employed at the blacksmith business, that kind of work being more destructive to clothes than any other.</p>

<p>The committee would therefore recommend, that in addition to the present annual supply of clothing, the blacksmiths be allowed one suit extra, and that caps or hats be furnished for all the convicts; they can be made by the tailors in the institution without much additional expense, and may be so made as to produce more uniformity of appearance among the convicts.</p><p>Your committee are pleased to find, that notwithstanding the institution has been compelled to part with some of its best workmen, and has laboured under disadvantages during the past year, it has been able to defray all its expenses, and has an unexpended balance on hand of three hundred and forty-three dollars and forty-three cents.</p><p>This gives the friends of the institution additional assurance that the institution may be so conducted as to be made a source of revenue instead of expense, besides saving the people from a great expense for the subsistence of criminals confined in the common jails.</p><p>Your committee propose the following resolution:</p><p><i>Resolved</i>, That the sum of five thousand dollars be inserted in the appropriation bill of the present session, for the purpose of repairing and raising the outer wall of the penitentiary.</p><p>Agreed to, 21st December, 1835.</p><p>ROBERT M.

<page id="GA1835.1.P311" no="GA1835.1.315" />

the valleys of the Ohio and Mississippi, and the Southern Atlantic coast, report:</p><p>In the magnificent valley of the Mississippi, attempts are now being made to connect by railroad, that splendid portion our country with some port on the Atlantic. From information received in relation to this project, your committee believe that the enterprize has been projected by men whose characters and talents afford ample guarantees for its ultimate success. Meetings of the capitalists, and other citizens of the west, have been held; examinations and surveys are making; charters are asked, and will no doubt be granted, for roads in different parts of the western States; and combinations of wealth, talents and influence are in process of organization, which in the opinion of your committee must result in a few years in a line of railroads from the Ohio to the Atlantic. A scheme so vast and brilliant in its conception, and so eventful in its results would, a few years ago, have been looked upon as impracticable and visionary, but now is admitted by all to be quite within the range of practicable results. An union of the great west with the populous regions of the Atlantic coast, is not only possible but an easy enterprize. Your committee predicate this opinion estimates and observations made by gentlement of distinguished engineering and commercial attainments. They have no doubt that the period is not far removed when the rich volume of western commerce shall flow to the Atlantic, fertilizing in its course entire States, rearing cities, fructifying fields, removing prejudices, and confirming our glorious Union. Your committee will not stop to inquire into the commercial and pecuniary advantages of the proposed road. Suffice it to say, that the empire of the west, with its teeming wealth and overflowing population, in spite of the Alleghany, will be planted on the Atlantic, open to the commerce of the world; and the warm and rich clime of the south, will find itself upon the banks of the Mississippi, receiving tribute from the lakes, the Rocky Mountains and the populous States watered by the Ohio, the Tennessee, the Illinois, the Missouri and the Arkansas; nor will they linger to ask what will be the social and political good that is to be expected from it. They will only remark, that among other advantages which railroads afford, free and frequent intercourse between the States is most conspicuous. The misconceptions, errors and prejudices of time and distance are thus happily removed; the warm and amicable charities of social life pass with the ebbing and flowing of commerce, and bind brethren in bonds

<page id="GA1835.1.P312" no="GA1835.1.316" />

nearer than those of blood. But above all other benefits of railroads, the most enlarged and permanent, is the strength and fixedness with which it establishes the Union, by the creation of mutual dependence, and mutuality of interests between the States. Your committee, therefore, entertain no doubt but that the General Assembly will agree with them in the proposition, that railroads are of great national and domestic utility. In the progress of the Cincinnati undertaking, a report of great ability, with the opinions of eminent engineers, has been transmitted to the authorities of the southern States and the municipal authorities of some of their principal towns, thus inviting the aid and active co-operation of the south in the inception and completion of the enterprize.</p><p>Responsive to these invitations, the citizens of Charleston have considered the scheme, hailed it as auspicious to their interests, and resolved to afford their hearty co-operation. In pursuance of which resolution, the city of Charleston have voted five thousand dollars to defray the expenses of a survey of their own State, with the view of meeting upon their own border the great road of the west. In addition to this, your committee learn that the legislature of Carolina will in all probability adopt the most active and prompt measures for bringing the road through that State, from the mountains to the Charleston and Hamburg road. The route of the road from Cincinnati, is of course not yet settled, and can be settled judiciously, only upon accurate surveys. It has, however, been suggested that it shall run through a pass of the Alleghany mountains, known as the Saluda Gap, in the State of North Carolina, and thence into the State of South Carolina, and unite with the Charleston and Hamburg road at the most eligible point. The attention of the western States will be early directed to the ascertainment of the route most practicable, and all the energies of the State of South Carolina will be directed to the location of that route within that State. With a knowledge of all these facts, the memorialists have asked of the General Assembly, that an engineer of unquestioned ability be appointed to make an exploration of the mountainous region of our State, lying on its north and and northwestern borders, with a view of ascertaining whether there be, across the foot of the Alleghany ridge, within our own limits, a pass for the Cincinnati road, of easier approach and less expensive transition than any yet suggested The memorialists believe there is, and from all the information at the command of your committee, they also have arrived at the same conclusion. The route from Knoxville,

<page id="GA1835.1.P313" no="GA1835.1.317" />

in Tennessee, would traverse the valley of the Little Tennessee towards its source, and arrive at the pass, by pursuing some one of its tributaries, many of which rise within the valley over which the ridge is passed. The gap of the mountain is itself a beautiful and rich plain, presenting not even the slightest obstacle to the construction of a railroad; from this point the route would descend the valley of some one of the many tributaries and streams which rise on the eastern face of the mountain and make the Savannah. It is a fact that, at the place referred to in the county of Rabun, in this State, the sources of streams running westwardly into the Mississippi, and those running into the Atlantic, are but a few miles removed, and seem at their fountains to be doubtful whether they will swell the volume of the Mississippi, or sweeten the salt waters of the Atlantic. This route is clearly practicable, and well worth the attention of the people of the west, and the enlightened citizens of Charleston. The fact that a part of the distance from Augusta to the Rabun outlet is already under contract, and that these contracts will be executed in the hands of the Georgia Union Railroad, your committee refer to simply as inducement to the companies of the west to explore the southern point of the Alleghany within the State of Georgia. It is a fact, stated by the intelligent body of citizens who have addressed the memorial to the legislature, now under review, that no stationary engine will be necessary to overcome any elevation to be encountered between the interior of the State and the mountains. Your committee believe that it will contribute greatly to the interest and prosperity of the whole State, and more particularly to that of the northern and northwestern counties, to have a survey made of the route from some place in the up country of Georgia, across the mountain to Knoxville, in Tennessee. The legislature will see at once that the advantage will depend upon the chance of the Cincinnati road coming through our State, and that it will come through our State, if the route is most practicable, there can be no doubt; for in this, as all other cases, monied enterprize will unerringly pursue its best interest when ascertained. But unless the facilities of this route are ascertained by a survey and presented to the citizens of the west, it is not likely that their attention will be directed to it, when vigorous efforts are making to draw that attention elsewhere. Admitting, however, for the sake of the argument, that the communication by railroad from the city of Cincinnati to the Atlantic should be made through our State, it will be readily granted that to the State the profit would be enormous. Commerce throughout her

whole limits would acquire an impetus which would give vigour and health to all the avocations of life; land would rise in value, the agriculture of the hills would find a cheap market at the seaboard, and society exhibit the aspect of improved cheerfulness, strength and intelligence. Such views are not visionary; such changes have been wrought elsewhere, as by magic. Population has arisen upon the waste, cities upon the verge of unbroken forests, and commerce where for years no capital invited it.</p><p><i>Resolved therefore</i>, That the General Assembly of the State of Georgia view with deep interest the movements of the people of the west, having for their object the connexion of the flourishing city of Cincinnati with the southern Atlantic coast; and that in their efforts to accomplish this splendid enterprize, they have our warmest sympathy, and shall have our cordial co-operation.</p><p><i>Resolved</i>, That the Governor be, and he is hereby requested to employ an engineer of character and ability, to examine the passes through the Alleghany mountains, in the northern boundary of this State, with a view to bring the railroad from Cincinnati to the southern Atlantic coast, through the territory of Georgia, and that the expenses of said examination be paid out of the contingent fund.</p><p>Agreed to, 25th Nov. 1835.</p><p>ROBERT M.

Many of the papers or records are deposited without that regard to system, so necessary to prompt reference in the management of so important a public office. The files of ungranted or detached plats are, many of them, in a state of mutilation and transposition beggaring description: add to this, that some of the detached plats are entirely missing. The plans or maps of districts are, many of them, becoming defaced, notwithstanding a judicious plan has heretofore been adopted for their safe keeping; they are frequently out of place, either by transposition or being left carelessly about the office, open or rolled up, according to the convenience or care of the last individual inspecting them. The inquiry naturally arises, to what causes are those irregularities in one of the most important offices in the State attributable? To any one who will take the trouble to visit the office at any time, but more especially during the session of the legislature, the answer will be obvious. The committee know of no record or file of the office which is not only accessible to members themselves, but to all classes and grades of persons who visit the office. This is wrong, and should not any longer be permitted. The system must be changed, and a different intercourse with the office adopted, or the consequences to many of the good people of the State may be serious, together with the vastly increased labour, embarrassment and responsibility imposed on the office by the present custom.</p><p>Your committee believe that the derangement of the office is more attributable to the practice of the members of the legislature themselves, in overhauling books and papers,

<page id="GA1835.1.P320" no="GA1835.1.324" />

<p>It appears that the whole amount of banking capital for commercial purposes is four millions five hundred and seventy-one thousand dollars. Bills in circulation, on the fifth of October last, three millions nine hundred and forty-two thousand dollarssix hundred and twenty-nine thousand dollars less than the capital stock paid in: that the specie in the vaults is two millions one hundred and eleven thousand dollars, a little less than half the capital, and something more than half the amount of bills in circulation. Since the exclusion by law of bank bills under five dollars, we find an abundance of specie in circulation, and your committee think it may equal the amount in the vaults.</p><p>Taking this for granted, the result would be that there is in the State about three hundred thousand dollars in gold and silver over and above the circulating bills. This view of the subject places our monied institutions on high ground, and speaks loudly in their behalf.</p><p>Your committee would not be invidious in drawing comparisons between the aforesaid institutions, but they may say that the Planters' Bank of Savannah has strong claims on the favour of the State when she asks for a renewal of her charter, and your committee confidently recommend that her prayer be granted.</p><p>In a <i>perspective view</i> of the whole subject of our banking operations, including those connected with the railroads now under consideration, together with the proposed Milledgeville Bank, and comparing them with our annual exports, the following statement is presented:</p><table><tr align="LEFT" valign="TOP"><td>Annual exports,</td><td align="RIGHT">$20,000,000</td></tr><tr align="LEFT" valign="TOP"><td /><td align="RIGHT" /></tr><tr align="LEFT" valign="TOP"><td /><td align="RIGHT" /></tr><tr align="LEFT" valign="TOP"><td /><td align="RIGHT" /></tr><tr align="LEFT" valign="TOP"><td>Banking capital now in operation,</td><td align="RIGHT">4,000,000</td></tr><tr align="LEFT" valign="TOP"><td>Milledgeville Bank,</td><td align="RIGHT">500,000</td></tr><tr align="LEFT" valign="TOP"><td>Two Railroad banks,</td><td align="RIGHT">3,000,000</td></tr><tr align="LEFT" valign="TOP"><td /><td align="RIGHT" /></tr><tr align="LEFT" valign="TOP"><td /><td align="RIGHT" /></tr><tr align="LEFT" valign="TOP"><td /><td align="RIGHT" /></tr><tr align="LEFT" valign="TOP"><td>Whole amount of Bank capital,</td><td align="RIGHT">$7,500,000</td></tr></table><p>Being only two-fifths of our annual exports.</p><p>It will be observed that your committee have not confined

Elijah Sinclair, the commissioner appointed by the Governor to disburse the sum of three thousand dollars appropriated by the last legislature to educate the indigent deaf and dumb in this State, have had the same under consideration, and report:</p><p>That it must be pleasing to the good people of this State to learn, that pending the various subjects of complication which were necessarily before the last legislature, that reflection and time was given to commence the very interesting inquiry into the condition of the indigent deaf and dumb in this State, and to make the first attempt by legislative aid to afford them some relief, the sum of three thousand dollars was appropriated; and his excellency the Governor, to carry the humane intentions of the legislature into effect, appointed the Rev. Elijah Sinclair commissioner, who, in pursuance of his said appointment, travelled into twenty-five counties in this State in search of suitable individuals, between the age of twelve and twenty years, to participate in the appropriation of the legislature; and from the report of the commissioner, which is full and satisfactory, it appears that he has sent six boys to the American Asylum at Hartford, in the state of Connecticut, who are now enjoying the benefits of profitable instruction. It will be seen by Mr. Sinclair's report that he has only expended the sum of nine hundred and thirty-three dollars eighty-six and three-fourths cents, and that the balance of said appropriation, amounting to the sum of two thousand and sixty-six dollars thirteen and one-fourth cents, is now on hand, and has been deposited in the Central Bank. Mr. Sinclair is of opinion that many indigent deaf and dumb mutes may be had in this State, who would most willingly participate as beneficiaries in an appropriation, if made by the State, and

<page id="GA1835.1.P327" no="GA1835.1.331" />

suggests the propriety that the present legislature should make an appropriation, with the sum now on hand, sufficient to educate, clothe and support twenty-six indigent deaf and dumb individuals for the year one thousand eight hundred and thirty-six; and from his estimate it appears the sum of four thousand four hundred and fifty dollars will be necessary, in addition to the sum of two thousand and sixty-six dollars thirteen and one-fourth cents, now on hand. Of the appropriation made by the last legislature for all of the necessary expenses of twenty-six indigent deaf and dumb mutes at the American Asylum, including the six now at that institution, your committee cannot hesitate in recommending to the legislature to make the necessary additional appropriation, necessary to educate twenty-six indigent deaf and dumb mutes, for the year 1836.

Elijah Sinclair for his services as commissioner to carry into effect the intentions of the last legislature, to educate the indigent deaf and dumb mutes in this State.

The <i>necessity</i> of the guard was placed entirely at the discretion of the Governor, and your committee conceive, from the documents presented to them on this subject, that the Governor acted with great deliberation and prudence in consenting to the establishment of said guard. As far back as the tenth of April, of the present year, Governor Lumpkin received a communication from Newtown, Cherokee county, signed by a number of the citizens, in which they state that the exposed situation of those whom interest has induced to settle in this portion of Georgia before the Indians have left it, the extraordinary excitement among the Indians in relation to the recent treaty at Washington, gives just ground to apprehend from them many wanton and barbarous murders, and other violent measures, c. We therefore respectfully solicit that protection of your excellency, that we feel confident you will extend to us. The Governor also received another communication to the same effect, signed by a number of citizens, and dated Cassville, the fourteenth of May, one thousand

<page id="GA1835.1.P333" no="GA1835.1.337" />

eight hundred and thirty-five, in which they state that they had been requested by gentlemen of this and adjacent counties, who attended our adjourned court, to memorialize your excellency for the aid of such force as is given to your excellency for the aid of such force as is given to your excellency by the late laws and resolutions for this purpose. In a communication to his excellency, from the agent, Colonel William N. Bishop, dated Spring Place, the fifteenth of May one thousand eight hundred and thirty-five, he says, Our country is now full of bloody assassins, and our white population are considerably alarmed; and those Cherokees friendly to Ridge and his course, seriously apprehend danger; and of both the whites and Cherokees, of the description above named, I am every day receiving solicitations to inform you of the true situation of their exposures. The Governor, in a letter dated the twenty-eighth of May, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-five, in answer to the communication of the citizens of Gassville, says, I have received your letters and the papers signed by yourselves and many other respectable citizens of the Cherokee circuit, requesting the organization of a military force for the protection of the citizens of said circuit, c. The great importance and gravity of the subject you present, calls for the most mature deliberation. The consequences involved in the course which you recommend, are inseparably connected with the character the honour and best interests of the State, <i>and that</i>, to an extent not apprehended by the hasty and inconsiderate.</p><p>It will be perceived that his excellency the Governor acted with caution and prudence in the discharge of this <i>delicate and important</i> discretion which had been imposed upon him by the legislatore. In a letter under date of the twenty-fifth of May, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-five, directed to Colonel William N. Bishop, the Governor says, After the most deliberate consideration, I am forced to the conclusion, under all the existing circumstances connected with the present state of our Indian affairs, that every legal effort should be made at the present time to avert the evils and calamities which seem to apprehended by you and others. The only legal discretion confided to the executive, upon this subject, is to be found in the resolution of the last legislature, which authorized the Governor, c. [Here follows the resolution before quoted.] The Governor continues, I believe the time has arrived when a wise and prudent use of the contemplated force may be made to great advantage. But every thing depends upon a prudent organization and employment of such force. Whether for

<page id="GA1835.1.P334" no="GA1835.1.338" />

good or evil, will chiefly depend upon a <i>judicious and discreet</i> exercise of the power confided by the legislature.</p><p>Although the legislature left the establishment of the Guard discretionary with the Governor, yet in the humble opinion of your committee, that discretion had a <i>limit</i>, and your committee believe that <i>limit</i> had arrived, if the communications sent to the Governor were worthy of credence; for the exigency had arisen when it became necessary to call out a force for the <i>relief, security and protection</i> of our citizens and the friendly Cherokees. And your committee most humbly conceive, that if any censure is due for the organization of the Georgia Guard, it falls upon the fast legislature and not the late executive of Georgia. Your committee believe also, that the late executive ought not to be held responsible for the conduct and improprieties of said Guard, so far as they are enabled to judge from the documents placed before this committee. Your committee, however, regret that there are some letters referred to, in the correspondence of his excellency, which are not to be found amongst the documents sent to your committee. Your committee <i>presume</i> that said letters were omitted from inadvertence, or because they were not necessary to be communicated. From the correspondence before your committee it appears that his excellency the Governor, in his letters to the commander of the Guard, warned him to discretion, entreated him to prudence, and in all cases directed him to be subservient to, and dependent upon the civil authorities of the country. In a letter dated the twenty-eighth of May last, to Colonel William N. Bishop, the Governor says, The object of the contemplated force, is the <i>security, relief and protection</i> of our citizens and the friendly Cherokees. How shall this object be attained? We shall find that a strict regard to the laws of the country, by affording every aid in our power to secure the ends of civil justice, will most effectually <i>secure, relieve and protect</i> the weak and innocent portion of our community. In determining upon the organization of the contemplated force, it has been my earnest desire that we might have no duty to perform which might be considered strictly military. So far as events have yet transpired, we have nothing to justify the belief that the crimes which have been committed in the Cherokee part of Georgia, may not be punished by a faithful enforcement of the civil authority of the country. We should, therefore, look well to that branch which the constitution has provided for the arraingnment and punishment of offenders.</p>

<page id="GA1835.1.P335" no="GA1835.1.339" />

<p>Again, the Governor, in his letter of instructions to the commander of the Guard, bearing date on the seventeenth of June, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-five, says, Let it be constantly borne in mind, that under the existing state of things, your military command is designed only to aid the civil authority in carrying into effect the laws of the State. In the same letter the Governor says, Under all the circumstances, it will be most prudent, in all cases where arrests are to be made, to obtain warrants from some judicial officer, in the due form of law, and be attended by a civil officer duly authorized to execute the same; thus you will, in most cases of arrest, only aid the civil authority in a proper execution of the laws of the State. And in the same letter he says, You may safely arrest all persons who may be found in the commission of crime; but when the information comes from others, require warrants, and take authority to arrest in the presence of a civil officer. Your committee conceive, that the foregoing quotations from the correspondence of the late Governor, are sufficient to show that his excellency used his <i>authority and influence</i> to keep the Guard subservient to the civil authorities of the country. If they have transcended the power and confidence reposed in them by the Governor, the just indignation of the community should fall upon them and not the Governor, who was removed far away from the scene of their operations. Your committee have dwelt thus long upon the propriety of the organization of the Guard, because they believe that a duty had devolved upon them to lay this matter before the people in its proper light, as an act of justice to the late Governor of Georgia. They have discharged that duty with <i>pleasure</i> to themselves. Your committee proceed now to the further discharge of their duty by inquiring, first, as to the conduct of the Guard in the recent arrest and detention of John Howard Payne; and secondly, as to the propriety of their reorganization. Your committee greatly regret that they have not all the facts relative to the recent arrest of John Howard Payne by the Georgia Guard in such a shape that <i>implicit credit</i> might be given to them. They are compelled then in the investigation of this branch of the subject, to discard all the <i>contradictory statements</i> found in newspapers, and to decide only from such facts as have been legitimately brought before them in the communications of the Governor. It is, however, admitted on all hands, that the recent arrest of Mr. Payne was made in the State of Tennessee. Your committee conceive that the Guard transcended their power in crossing the line of the State of Georgia to arrest an individual out of

<page id="GA1835.1.P336" no="GA1835.1.340" />

the limits of this State. And your committee believe, that it was an act of which the sovereign State of Tennessee has just right of complaint against the authorities of Georgia.</p><p>The only testimony before your committee, relative to thu arrest of Mr. Payne, will be found in the communication of his excellency William Schley, of the tenth instant. In that communication the Governor says, I have received a communication dated the first of this instant, from Colonel William N. Bishop, the commander of the Cherokee guard, informing me that on his return from Milledgeville to Spring Place in November last, he found John Howard Payne in custody of the Guard; `who,' says Colonel Bishop, `was found engaged in examining and writing papers, suspected of some design against the government.'  This admission of the commander of the Guard is sufficient of itself to show the utter recklessness and want of authority in the Guard to make the arrest.</p><p>The fourth article in the amendments of the federal constitution is in the following words: The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, <i>shall not be violated:</i> and no warrant shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.</p><p>Your committee cannot conceive why the foregoing article was placed in the federal constitution, unless it was to protect the free citizens of the United States from unnecessary and improper arrest and confinement; and to preserve their papers and writings from the searches and seizures of those who might <i>suspect</i> them to be guilty <i>of some design against the government</i>. It appears, then, to your committee, that the Georgia Guard, in the recent arrest of John Howard Payne, trampled under foot the constitution of the United States. The commander of the Guard says, in his same letter to the Governor, I have examined those papers, and find some very improper and indiscreet statements in relation to the President, our government and State authorities and agents, both government and State agents, the Georgia Guard, c., and many bitter remarks concerning the Cherokee matters; but finally concluded that they were not of such a nature as would justify his being bound over to answer for his offence in our courts; I therefore, after keeping him a few days under guard, have

<page id="GA1835.1.P337" no="GA1835.1.341" />

discharged him. How long he was kept under guard before the arrival of Col. Bishop at Spring Place, your committee are uninformed. Yet it is evident to your committee that the instructions of the late executive to the Guard in this matter were entirely disregarded, for the Governor's <i>direct instructions</i> were, that whenever individuals were arrested for offences committed against the laws of Georgia, they were immediately to be brought before the civil authorities, to be dealt with as the law directs. But the commander of the Guard says, after examining his papers, and finding him guilty of no offence for which he was answerable in our courtsI, the commander of the Guard, kept him in custody a <i>few days</i> and then discharged him. Your committee would ask with feelings of mortification, why was he kept in custody <i>one minute</i> beyond the time when it was ascertained he had committed no offence? Was it to punish him for his <i>indiscreet statements in relation to the Georgia Guard?</i> Perhaps so. But in so doing, the Guard have violated every principle of the <i>constitution</i>, which guarantees <i>liberty and equal rights</i> to the citizens of this country. They have jeopardized the character and reputation of the State of Georgia abroad by this act of wanton and uncalled for vandalism, and will bring down upon the people of the State the inevitable and odious charge of inhospitality and cruelty to the stranger. Your committee conceive, therefore, that the State of Georgia can only relieve herself from the obnoxious charges and denunciations that will be made upon her by a firm, decided and unequivocal disapprobation of the conduct of the Guard in this matter, by the representatives of the people in their legislative capacity. The character and standing which the State of Georgia has always held amongst her sister States demands, that upon this subject, she should speak <i>firmly and quickly</i>.</p><p>Your committee proceed now to the last branch of the inquiryWhether the Guard, which has lately been disbanded, should be reorganized? Your committee humbly believe, that the establishment of a military force, of the nature and character of the Georgia Guard, is contrary to the spirit and true intent and meaning of the federal constitution. That instrument expressly declares, in the second article to section the tenth, that no State shall, without the consent of congress, lay any duty on tonnage, <i>keep troops</i> or ships of war in time of peace. Ours is a government founded upon opinion, and not force. Its laws must be executed by the good order and discretion of the people,

<page id="GA1835.1.P338" no="GA1835.1.342" />

and not by the bayonet and the sword. Our free institutions have failed of their end, and our government is not worth having, when <i>public opinion</i> cannot execute its laws. The reasons which existed at the time of the organization of the Georgia Guard, do not now exist. The Cherokee circuit is becoming daily more thickly settled. The courts in the different counties have become better organized. The civil officers have become better acquainted with their respective duties. A circuit thus organized presents the decided conviction to the mind of your committee, that the laws will be faithfully and judiciously administered.</p><p>If any danger is to be apprehended from the hostilities of the remnant of the Cherokees, now resident in that circuit, to our own citizens, it is perfectly idle to suppose that a small band of forty men can be of any service in their protection in the widely extended country. In case any danger of that sort should arise, our fellow citizens in that section of the country must look to themselves, and to the aid which will most <i>assuredly</i> and <i>speedily</i> be rendered them by their brethren in different sections of the State.</p><p>From every view, therefore, which your committee have been enabled to give this subject, they are decidedly of the opinion that there are no circumstances at present existing which would warrant a reorganization of the Georgia Guard.</p><p>Your committee therefore recommend the adoption of the following resolutions:</p><p><i>Resolved</i>, That the legislature highly disapprove of the conduct of the Georgia Guard in the recent arrest and confinement of John Howard Payne, in the Cherokee nation.</p><p><i>Resolved</i>, That the legislature consider it inexpedient to reorganize the Guard in the Cherokee circuit, which has been lately disbanded.</p><p><i>Resolved</i>, That the legislature approve of the course pursued by his excellency the Governor in drawing upon the unappropriated contingent fund for the year one thousand eight hundred and thirty-four, for the pay and expenses of the Georgia Guard, and that his excellency the Governor be authorized to draw upon said fund for the balance due said Guard.</p>

That the second section of that treaty reserves to the citizens of each State only equal privileges and equal exemption from tolls, hindrances, c.; that it will be obvious from reading that section, it was intended to deny to the citizens of Carolina the right to the use of the south channel of said river, lying to the south of Hutchinson island, and so long as the south channel was so denied to them, the right to the use of the north channel (which branches from the south channel at the upper end of Hutchinson island) was reserved to them; that after the adoption of the constitution of the United States, it was considered and understood that the citizens of Carolina were at liberty to use the south channel, and no objection being made, the north channel was seldom used by them, and more seldom still was the course laid down by that treaty for their use pursued. Upwards of twenty years since, an attempt was made to stop this northern channel of the river at the identical spot now proposed. No objection was made from any quarter: a line of palisades was driven, and had the work been successful, probably no objection would have been made It was not so, however, and although the work then done has caused such an accumulation of alluvial matter as nearly to prevent the use of this communication with the main river, it has not produced that effect on the main channel which is premised from the proposed work. Your committee, from an examination of the chart of the river, are satisfied that the obstruction proposed will improve the navigation of the river, and will do no injury to individuals, and that therefore the State of

Georgia should cheerfully yield her assent to it. Nor can they believe that the legislature of Carolina will withhold her assent, when it is considered that her citizens now enjoy the use of the south channel on precisely an equal footing with the citizens of Georgia; that this communication of the north branch with the main channel is now become useless to her citizens, from the accumulations aforementioned; that the proposed obstruction will benefit and improve the main channel of the river; that the back river and this northern branch will still convey to the low or rice lands in Carolina an ample supply of fresh water for irrigation, and therefore beg leave to offer the following resolutions:</p><p><i>Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of Georgia in General Assembly met</i>, That the assent of the State of Georgia to the proposed improvement, to be made under an act of congress, in the navigation of the Savannah river, by throwing or building an obstruction across the north channel of said river, from any point on Argyle island to any point on Hutchinson island, is hereby freely and fully and forever given and granted.</p><p><i>Resolved</i>, That his excellency the Governor be authorized to correspond with the executive of South Carolina, and to obtain through him a like authority and assent from the legislature of South Carolina for a work which will be of important and equal benefit to the citizens of both States.</p><p><i>Resolved</i>, That his excellency the Governor communicate these resolutions to the United States engineer having charge of said work at Savannah, and also to the war department.</p><p>Read and agreed to, 9th Dec. 1835.</p><p>JOSEPH DAY,</p><p>Speaker of the House of Representatives.</p><p>AttestJoseph Sturgis, Clerk.</p><p><i>In Senate,</i></p><p>Concurred in, Dec. 22d, 1835.</p><p>ROBERT M.

<law id="R1835V1N208" initial.page="356"><p>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.</p><p>The joint committee from the Senate and House of Representatives appointed to take into consideration the utility and practicability of saving the swamp lands on the Savannah river, by means of embankments, or otherwise, have had the subject under constant consideration, and beg leave respectfully to report:</p><p>That, to improve the condition, physical as well as moral, of the country in which we live, and to which we are bound by all the ties which consecrate our homes, is a work to the successful completion of which the wise and the good will anxiously contribute. National success is certainly the result of individual prosperity, and that system of internal improvement which will most probably eventuate in the achievement of the one, will as surely conduce to the consummation of the other. That Georgia possesses vast and as yet unexplored natural resources, is evident to the most superficial observer. The facilities and advantages of her location, the variety and fertility of her soil, the salubrity of her climate, the extent of her territory, and the genius and character of her people, point to her as a State destined, before the lapse of another century, to occupy a proud and enviable position among her emulous confederates. Of the numerous objects of improvement within our limits, the swamp lands which lie along the western bank of the Savannah river, present claims upon the consideration of the political economist, which may well arrest his attention; and your committee, by the direction of the legislature, have earnestly directed their inquiries to the utility and practicability of saving them from the inundations of the river. That part of the swamp which your committee deem worthy of attention, is to be found between Augusta and the head of tideway, on the Savannah river; its average width is about one mile, and the probable length from one hundred and thirty to one hundred and fifty miles. These lands, at present comparatively worthless to the planter, and of little avail to the State, are believed to be inferior in fertility to no part of the habitable globe. The soil, which

<page id="GA1835.1.P353" no="GA1835.1.357" />

is alluvial, is a rich mould, formed originally of decomposed vegetable deposits, believed to be altogether inexhaustible, and extending down to the depth of from four to five feet.</p><p>To reclaim such lands, and reduce them into successful cultivation, your committee believe would, in all probability, result in vast and inestimable benefits, not only to that region of country, but to the whole State of Georgia. The people of Augusta and Savannah would be among the first to experience the advantages of such an operation; and the poor of these cities, who are dependent for support upon their daily supplies, would be enabled to procure their provisions at one half their present price. Corn, which is the first and most material item in the supplies of a family, instead of commanding, as it does now, from eighty cents to one dollar, would be a drug at twenty-five or thirty-seven and a half cents per bushel; and rice, wheat, rye, oats, and all the breadstuffs which are now grown in this country, would be reduced in price precisely in proportion to the increase of the supply. Your committee do not exaggerate these probable results, for they are assured by men who are experienced in agricultural pursuits, that these swamp lands are capable, with proper cultivation, of producing from fifty to one hundred bushels of corn per acre, and other grain in the same proportion; for even now, under every disadvantage, and when, from fear of freshets, the farmer cannot venture to pitch his crop before the first of May, and sometimes not before the first of July, from thirty to sixty bushels to the acre are considered a moderate return. If then they were saved from inundation, it is evident, and every farmer knows, and will acknowledge, that the advantages of early preparation and early planting, would, in all probability, with moderate and usual seasons, insure the supposed increase of production.</p><p>In addition to these articles of prime and necessary consumption, the great staple commodities of sugar-cane and cotton would be diligently cultivated, and for the same reasons as above, would yield an additional increase. Cane will now ripen up to ten and fifteen joints, and short staple cotton return from one thousand to fifteen hundred weight, in the seed, to the acre on these lands; and if the fresh water was not permitted to retard the cultivation, and molest the growth of these plants, the husbandman will assuredly gather a much more abundant crop. Horses, hogs, cattle and stock of all sorts, would then be raised at home from our overflowing barns, and a considerable portion of the large amount of money which the drovers of the west now annually draw out of the State, would be saved to our people

<page id="GA1835.1.P354" no="GA1835.1.358" />

and retained in the country. Our export of raw material would be greatly increasedthe farmer and the merchant would receive from that increase additional wealththe price of real and personal estate in Augusta, Savannah, and the intermediate country, would be enhanced; and all the beneficial consequences of plenty and prosperity, in their thousand various ramifications, would be felt and acknowledged by the rich and the poor.</p><p>If the waters were at all times confined to their natural channel, those who are at all conversant with that stream will at once perceive that the navigation of the Savannah river would be in a short time most materially improved. The sand and mud bars, which are at present the chief obstruction to the passage of steam and pole boats, would in a little while be washed away by the direct, confined, and therefore violent rush of the waters, and the bed or channel of the river would be consequently materially deepened; good wagon roads would be made through any part of the swamp, over which the best steamboat wood could be supplied, at one half its present price, at almost any point on the river; and of course freights, which are now enormously high, would be lowered in proportion to the increased facilities of transportation. The miasmatic and sickly region of the swamp would be made dry and salubrious, and the health of the neighbouring inhabitants consequently improved. Thus all classes of people, the boat owner, the merchant, the farmer, the citizen, and every man from the up country, who trades either to Augusta or Savannah, would reap almost incalculable advantages from the successful completion of such a work. Your committee hope and believe they have established, even from this imperfect view of the subject referred to them, the great and absolute utility of saving these river swamp lands, and it only remains for them to inquire into the probable practicability of such a project.</p><p>If the final and complete success of the past affords any criterion by which to judge of the probable termination of future experiments of a similar character, and if well known facts are permitted to influence the opinion of your committee, then there can be very little doubt of the entire practicability of restraining the waters of the Savannah river to their natural channel, by embankments. The dikes of Holland, the artificial banks of the river Po in Italy, and the levees which effectually confine the Mississippi, one of the most powerful rivers in the world, for two hundred

<page id="GA1835.1.P355" no="GA1835.1.359" />

miles above New Oreans, to her original bed, are indisputable evidence that the Savannah river may be dammed in, and the adjacent swamp rendered perfectly arable. In addition to these facts your committee have availed themselves of the views and opinions of many intelligent farmers and practical men, all of whom agree with your committee, and fully concur in the opinions they herewith express.</p><p>The only objection to such a project is the difficulty of obtaining the means of operation. But it is believed that the removal of this difficulty is wholly within the power of those who may interest themselves in the work. No effort in such an undertaking could possibly avail any thing, unless the individuals directly engaged should promptly adopt a judicious system of operation, and be governed in all their movements by unanimity and concert of action. In such a case the State of Georgia, being always well disposed to foster and protect works of internal improvement, when predicated of individual enterprise, would not, in the opinion of your committee, be averse to lending her name in order to negotiate a loan of money, to forward and promote the undertaking. The State of course, in justice to her own interests, would require to be well secured by pledges of personal responsibility, and valuable and available property, before she would consent to become liable for a single cent. But if the State was secured beyond the possibility of loss, your committee cannot perceive why she should not be ready to aid her people in the manner proposed, in a work of such probable success and beneficial consequences, especially when the loss, if any accrues, must and will fall, not upon the State, but upon those whose persons and property will be liable to the redemption of the debt.</p><p>In consideration of all which your committee respectfully recommend the adoption of the following resolutions:</p><p><i>Resolved</i>, That it would be a work of great utility, and that it is practicable to save the swamp lands on the Savannah river from inundation, by means of embankments.</p><p><i>Resolved</i>, That his excellency the Governor be requested to employ a competent engineer, whose duty it shall be to proceed immediately to make an accurate and correct survey of said river bank, and such adjacent parts of the swamp as he may deem necessary, with a view to the construction of said embankment; that he report fully of the premises to
