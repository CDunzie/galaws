There seems to exist in the minds of many of the Ordinaries and Deputy Clerks of Ordinary throughout the State, very erroneous ideas of the respective powers and duties of those officers. This has arisen from two causes; 1st, a too inattentive reading of the amendment adopted in 1852 to the old Constitution; and 2nd, the ambiguous wording of the Act passed in the same year, to carry that amendment into effect by organizing the Court of Ordinary under it. That amendment, which, with very slight modifications, has been incorporated in, and forms a part of the new Constitution, is in the following language, to-wit:</p><p><blockquote><p>The powers of a Court of Ordinary or Register of Probates, shall be vested in an Ordinary for each county, from whose decisions there may be an appeal to the Superior Court, under such restrictions and regulations as may be, or may have been prescribed by law. The said Ordinary shall be <i>[Illegible Text] officio</i> Clerk of said Court, and may appoint a Deputy Clerk. The Ordinary, as Clerk, or his Deputy, may issue Citations and grant Temporary Letters of Administration, to hold until permanent Letters are granted; and said Ordinary, as Clerk, or his Deputy, may grant Marriage Licenses. The Ordinaries in and for the respective counties, shall be elected as other County Officers are, on the first Monday in January, Eighteen Hundred and Fifty-Two, and every fourth year thereafter, and shall be commissioned by the Governor for the term of four years; in case of a vacancy in said office of Ordinary, from any cause, the same shall be filled by election, as is provided in relation to other County Officers, and until the same is filled, the Clerk of the Superior Court for the time being, shall act as Clerk of said Court of Ordinary.</p><p>By a careful reading of the above, it will be seen, that there is no such officer as Deputy Ordinary The Ordinary is, <i>ex officio,</i> Clerk of Ordinary; and may have a Deputy Clerk of Ordinary, but cannot have a Deputy Ordinary. The Ordinary, as such, may do certain Acts, among which are all the <i>judicial</i> acts performed by the Court; and the power to perform these acts, he cannot delegate to another; first, because the Constitution does not authorize him to do so; and second, because it is an established principle of the common law, that <i>judicial powers</i> cannot be delegated. As <i>ex officio</i> Clerk, the incumbent of the office of Ordinary, may do certain acts enumerated in the Constitution, viz.: may issue citations, [Illegible Text] grant temporary letters of administration to hold until permanent letters are granted; and may grant marriage licenses. The same acts may be performed by the Deputy Clerk of Ordinary, but no others; for instance, the person who holds the office of Ordinary, and by the Constitution and laws is authorized to perform all the <i>judicial duties</i> of the office, when acting as Clerk of Court cannot issue permanent letters of administration, nor admit a will to probate, nor grant an order to sell land or negroes, nor sit upon and decide any issue in the Court of Ordinary, any more than a Clerk of the Superior Court could do the judicial duties of the Judge of that Court.These acts can be done by him only when acting as <i>Ordinary,</i> that is, when sitting as a Judge of his Court, at a regular term.</p><p>If the Ordinary die, or resign, the Deputy Clerk of Ordinary, if he had one, ceases [Illegible Text] be such, both in accordance with that principle of the common law which declares that, on the death of a principal, the agent, or deputy, loses his powers to act as such, and because it is expressly provided in the last clause of said amendment, that in case of a vacancy in the office of Ordinary, until the same is filled, the Clerk of the Superior Court for the time being, shall act as said <i>Clerk of [Illegible Text]</i> When a Clerk of the Superior Court, in this way, becomes Clerk of Ordinary, he can as such, do those acts only which the Ordinary, had there been no vacancy, as Clerk of Ordinary, or his Deputy Clerk of Ordinary, could have done, and no others.</p><p>From the [Illegible Text] language of parts of the Act of January 21, 1852, [Laws of 1854-2, p. 91.] it is not surprising that the impression has been made upon minds not accustomed to the close [Illegible Text] nor possessing the legal acumen of the thorough bred lawyer, that there is such an officer as Deputy Ordinary. In the 14th Section of the Act, after providing that the Ordinary shall give bond and security, in the sum of two thousand dollars, for the faithful discharge of his duties as a Clerk, it is enacted, that said Ordinary shall have power to take bond and security, from his Deputy, for the faithful performance of his duty as such. This latter clause is calculated to mislead the mind and to leave the impression upon it, that the bond is to be taken of a Deputy Ordinary, whereas the intention was to authorize a bond to be given by the Deputy Clerk of Ordinary. Again, in the next section, after prescribing the official oath to be taken by each Ordinary, (not merely as Clerk. of Ordinary, for no separate oath is required of him as such,) it is provided, that each and every deputy appointed under the provisions of this Act, shall take and subscribe a similar oath. If he does take and subscribe a similar oath, he swears that he will well and faithfully discharge the duties of Ordinaryor Deputy Ordinaryfor the county of, c., which certainly was not intended to be required of him; but that he should take an oath that he will well and faithfully discharge the duties of <i>Deputy Clerk of Ordinary</i> for the county of, c.</p></blockquote></p></footnote><sidenote>Acts of G.

An end to the unfortunate controversy, which has been pending so long, is due alike to the citizens of both States, bordering upon the line of dispute. The settlement of this question is demanded that no infringement upon the sovereignty of either State shall happen, nor any question arise, as to conflicting jurisdictions. The undisputed right of citizenship and allegiance should no longer be kept in doubt; and the limits of the respective sovereignties should be fully determined, recognized and understood. <sidenote>Bondary line between Georgia and Florida.</sidenote></p>

<page id="GA1861.1.P130" no="GA1861.1.134" />

<p>The Legislature of Georgia desires to address the Legislative authority of Florida in a spirit of amity and kindness; and to appeal to her, upon the principles of comity and good neighborhood, to contribute everything she can, compatible with her honor and sense of right, to the adjustment of our unsettled boundary, a source of irritation, discontent and dissatisfaction. The State of Georgia is not unaware of the points of difference existing ever since the treaty between the United States and Spain, of 1795, (and even prior thereto.) She understood her boundary. The 3rd Article of the Treaty of 1795 defines what should be the correct line of division; which is in these words: The southern boundary which divides, their territory from the Spanish Colonies of East and West Florida, shall be designated by a line beginning on the river Mississippi, at the northernmost part of the thirty-first degree of latitude north of the Equator, which from thence shall be drawn east to the middle of the river Apalachicola or Chattahoochee, thence along the middle thereof to its junction with the Flint; thence straight to the head of the St. Mary's river, and thence down the middle thereof to the Atlantic Occan. Commissioners were appointed under the treaty to perform their duty in running the line designated by the terms thereof; and the mode of proceeding by said treaty, is declared thus: In order to carry the preceding Article (the 3rd Article,) into effect, one Commissioner and one Surveyor shall be appointed by each of the contracting parties, who shall meet at the Natchez, on the other side of the river Mississippi, before the expiration of six months from the ratification of this Convention; and they shall proceed to run and mark this boundary according to the stipulations of said Article. They shall make plats, and keep journals of the proceedings, which shall be considered part of this Convention; and shall have the same force as if they were inserted therein. From the Mississippi to the Chattahoochee they executed their commission according to the stipulations of the treaty. The remaining part of their duty they failed to perform. The point of departure and the point of termination are both fixed by the treaty; and it is provided that said Commissioners should run and mark, to and from those points. The points referred to are from the junction of the Flint and Chattahoochee rivers, to the head of the St. Marys. It is a historical fact that no surveys were made between the junction of the Flint and Chattahoochee rivers, and the head of the St. Marys, on account of Indian disturbances; that Ellicott designated on his plat, Mound B., as being a little north of the head waters of the St. Marys, and being the northern branch of the said river, and consented that this point should indicate the true source of said stream, may probably be insisted upon; but the fact is unquestionable that no such power was given him; he having power to act as a simple Commissioner, his duties and powers being limited by the treaty, which was the supreme law of the land. The evidence now exists that, at the time the Commissioners were endeavoring to ascertain the head of the St. Marys river, that, on account of the heavy rains and heavy freshets consequent

<page id="GA1861.1.P131" no="GA1861.1.135" />

thereupon, the low, flat district of country from whence the source of the river takes its rise, it was impossible for them to de-determine the fact. In fact Mound B. is not near the head source of said river, which is now, (since the country is settled,) capable of the fullest and most conclusive proof. Florida insists that Mound B. should be regarded the fixed point to determine the head waters of the river St. Marys. Georgia insists that the most southern branch of the river is the longest, and has the greatest volume of water; and, therefore, that the dividing line between the two States, from the junction of the Flint and Chattahoochee rivers, should be run to the head of the most southern stream. Thus, it will be seen, that if Georgia insists upon her view of the subject, she will claim a considerable portion of the territory of the State of Florida, and include many valuable citizens within the jurisdiction of Georgia. On the other hand, if Florida should adhere to her views, she would embrace a part of the territory of Georgia, and also take within her jurisdiction many of the recognized citizens of Georgia. It is obvious to the two States, holding these adverse positions, and insisting upon the abstract rights set up by each, a settlement of the contested boundary is impossible without long and tedious litigation between the two States, and before the Supreme Court of the Confederate States. The two sovereignties, from their position, being competent adjust these differences, it seems to the Legislature of Georgia that the question of boundary between them can be settled in a manner more compatible with the dignity, peace, friendship, amity, and good will of both. <sidenote>Treaty of 1795.</sidenote> <sidenote>Mode of running the line under the treaty of 1795.</sidenote></p><p>The General Assembly, to avoid further dispute, proposes to her sister State, Florida; that what is denominated the Watson line, (which will leave in the limits of this State, the fractional lots of land heretofore sold under an Act of her Legislature,) shall be adopted as the boundary line. The settlement upon this basis, will not interfere with the rights of citizenship, as claimed by the citizens of either State. The position of the two States, united by a common interest, and sharing perils alike with each other in resisting a common enemy, are considerations which require that border difficulties and disputes, and all causes of irritation, should be put an end to.</p><p><i>Be it therefore resolved,</i> That his Excellency the Governor, be requested to transmit the foregoing preamble and these resolutions, to his Excellency the Governor of Florida, with a request that he submit the same to the Legislature of Florida.</p><p><i>And resolved further,</i> That the Governor do appoint two Commissioners to visit the Seat of Government of the State of Florida; who are hereby clothed with authority to negotiate and settle the boundary line, with the authorities of Florida, upon the terms prescribed in the aforesaid recital and preamble, or upon such other terms as will include within the limits of Georgia, the lots and fractional lots of land disposed of by the authorities of the State of Georgia.</p><approvaldate>Assented to Dec. 11, 1861.</approvaldate></law>
