A careful examination of the evidence found in the records of the Macon and Brunswick Railroad Company, and in the reports of the Investigating Committees of the Legislature, has satisfied my mind that there was great irregularity in the issuing of the last $950,000 of the State's endorsement on the company's bonds, under the act approved December 3, 1866. These endorsements were made in palpable violation of the conditions in the resolutions explanatory of said act, which provided that the endorsement of the State upon the bonds of the company should not exceed $1,000,000, until an amount of capital equal to the additional endorsement should be <i>bona fide</i> subscribed and paid into the company. It is very clear from the evidence, that there was no <i>bona fide</i> subscription and payment of capital into the company after the State's endorsement was placed upon the first $1,000,000 of the company's

<page id="GA1875.1.P366" no="GA1875.1.372" />

bonds. Neither was there, in my judgment, even an indirect compliance with this very important condition. The company, it seems however, expended large sums in payment of interest, lawyers fees, etc., and it is sought to swell the amount of capital invested in the road by including such items. The amount of money invested in the company consists only of such sums as were expended for the right-of-way, for the purchase of material, and in payment for the labor required to construct the road, and for equipment. The Legislature that granted aid to the company would hardly have considered $40,000 of lawyers' fees, or several hundred thousand dollars of interest upon the company's debts such a <i>[Illegible Text]</i> subscription and payment of capital into the company, as would warrant the endorsement of its bonds by the State.</p><p>Inasmuch, however, as the validity of these indorsements have, after investigation, been affirmed by two General Assemblies, to which [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] do not find any constitutional objection, and thinking it probable that these bonds have passed into the hands of persons not properly chargeable with notice of any irregularity in the indorsements thereon, I consider it my duty to acquiesce in the action of the General Assembly.
