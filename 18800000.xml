Section 14 makes the stockholders liable for the debts of the bank to the extent of their unpaid stock, and to that extent only. I do not think it wise or just to thus limit their liability. The bank is authorized to receive deposits to an unlimited extent. Executors, administrators and guardians are allowed to deposit in it the funds of the estates and persons they represent. Where so much power is given to contract debts, there ought to be a better guaranty that they will be paid. If individuals become indebted, there is no limit to their liability to pay. Why should a bank or its stockholders be placed on a more favorable footing? Besides, it has become the well-settled policy of this State to incorporate in bank charters a provision making the stockholders responsible for the entire indebtedness of the corporation. I regard this policy as eminently sound and wise, and withhold my signature to the Act referred to because it fails to conform to it. <sidenote>Veto.</sidenote></p><p>Alfred H.

Barnett, Secretary of State, Atlanta, Ga.</i>;</p><p>SirYour communication, handed me yesterday, requests me to give you my opinion as to the status of An Act to be entitled An Act to incorporate the Commercial Bank of Savannah, which you state has been deposited in your office by the Governor, with the expression of his disapproval attached.</p><p>It appears that the bill passed on the 4th day of December, 1880, and was submitted to the Governor for his approval. He attached his disapproval thereto on the 9th day of that month, but the Legislature having adjourned on the 6th day of December until July, 1881, and not being in <i>actual</i> session when the bill was vetoed, the Governor retained the bill, <i>thus vetoed</i>, in his office until deposited by him in your office on yesterday or the day before. These are the facts, as I learn them from the records and the statement of the Governor, The bill was <i>never</i> returned to the house in which it originated with the disapproval of the Executivewhich the Constitution imperatively requires should be done within five days (Sundays excepted), unless the General Assembly by its adjournment prevents. The Legislature not being in actual session when the veto was signed, the Governor made the mistake of supposing that it had, by adjournment, prevented the return of the bill. It is well settled that the adjournment contemplated by the constitution is final adjournment. Had the bill, with the Executive disapproval, been delivered to either the presiding officer or clerk of the house in which it originated within five days after it was submitted to the Governor, or been sent back within five days after the re-assembling of the Legislature in July, 1881, I think it would have been sufficient and the veto would have become operative, unless overruled by a two-thirds' vote of the two houses; but not having left the Executive office until deposited, as stated, in your office, I am clear in the opinion that the attempted veto became inoperative, and that the bill has become, and <i>is, a law</i>, <sidenote>Opinion of Attorney-General.</sidenote></p><p>The correctness of this opinion will clearly appear by an examination of the following authorities: Cooley on Const. Limitations, top pp. 186, 187; 45th New Hampshire Reports, 607; 39th California Reports, 540,</p><p>Very respectfully,</p><p>Clifford Anderson,</p><p><i>Attorney-General of Georgia</i>.</p></div><approvaldate /><notediv><note><p>Note.The foregoing Act is printed, notwithstanding the veto of His Excellency, the Governor, because of the following opinion of the Attorney-General.Compiler.</p></note></notediv></law></lawdiv>
