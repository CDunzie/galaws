S. Thomas, Director of the Central Bank, in relation to the assets of the Bank of Darien, ask leave to make the following Report:</p><p>In the original charter of the Bank of Darien, the right to repeal the act at any time was reserved by the Legislature. The State became a stockholder in the Bank to the amonnt of $ 325,000, and individuals to the extent of $ 326,050, making the capital $ 651,050. The Bank of Darien suspended payment, and the Legislature, in virtue of the power which it reserved in the original charter, by an act assented to on the 10th day of December, 1841, repealed the charter and authorized the Central Bank of Georgia to proceed to wind up the affairs of the said Bank of Darien, to collect its assets, and to pay the debts thereof.</p><p>By the 10th section of the said act of 1841, it was enacted that if the Directors or stockholders, or any of them, should refuse to allow the provisions of that act to be carried into effect, his Excellency the Governor was instructed to commence such legal proceedings as might be necessary to protect the interests of the State and all others concerned, and if necessary to have application made to the Court of Chancery for the appointment of a receiver of the effects of the Bank.</p><p>It appears to your Committee that certain of the stockholders of the said Bank of Darien did, on the 30th December, 1841, protest to his Excellency, Charles J. McDonald, against the said act of 10th December, 1841, and again on the 7th day of January, 1842, certain other stockholders, and also certain judgment creditors of the Bank of Darien protested against the law of 1841.</p><p>It was the object of the protesting stockholders and judgment creditors, and so stated by them to Governor McDonald, to have the assets of the Bank of Darien placed under control of the Court of Chancery. His Excellency the Governor refused to listen to this protest, and refused to have the assets of the Bank of Darien placed under the control of the Court of Chancery. The letters of Governor McDonald, of dates the 1st, 6th, 12th and 15th January, 1842, addressed to the protesting stockholders, creditors and President of the Bank of Darien, shews such refusal. The refusal was placed upon the ground that the creditors and

<page id="GA1847.1.P304" no="GA1847.1.306" />

stockholders of the Bank of Darien would be seriously injured by pressing its debtors at a time of great pecuniary embarrassment, as would be the case if the assets were placed in the hands of a receiver, that the losses occasioned by urging the speedy collection of the debts by a receiver would be immeasurably greater than by any future probable mismanagement of the Directors.</p><p>Accordingly the assets of the Bank of Darien were in the early part of the year 1842 placed in the possession of the Central Bank of Georgia; in other words, in the hands of the State of Georgia, to wind up its affairs, to collect the assets, and to pay the debts.</p><p>From the reports before your Committee, it appears that all that has been collected by the Central Bank is as follows </p><table><tr align="LEFT" valign="TOP"><td>Collected in Darien Bank notes,</td><td align="RIGHT">$ 191,904 31</td></tr><tr align="LEFT" valign="TOP"><td>In specie funds, (after deducting agents and attorneys' fees, c</td><td align="RIGHT">23,766 30</td></tr></table><p>And the Director of the Central Bank, in his report, says that all the remaining good assets of the Bank amount only to the sum of $ 7,319 23.</p><p>The whole remaining assets, except some lands chiefly in the State of Mississippi, are considered of no value. The creditors of the Bank of Darien are calling on the State of Georgia for payment of such sums as the State is now liable to pay on account of said Bank. At the last session of the Legislature, the Planter's Bank of the State of Georgia and the Bank of the State of Georgia presented their claims, and the Committee on Finance of the House of Representatives made a report and submitted certain resolutions which were assented to on the 29th December, 1845. To that report, and to those resolutions, your Committee asks leave to refer. It was in obedience to those resolutions that the report of the Director of the Central Bank, now before your Committee, was made. In the annual messages of his Excellency Governor Crawford, in 1845 and 1847, and in the said report made at the last session, the liability of the State of Georgia to pay the bill-holders and creditors, in proportion to the amount of stock held by the State in the Bank of Darien, is distinctly admitted and shown.</p><p>The State is likely to lose a large sum on account of the Bank of Darien. As a stockholder, the State is, beyond all doubt in the minds of your Committee, bound to pay to all bona fide bill-holders and creditors in proportion to the stock held by the State. Certain judgments have been obtained on the Bank bills of the Bank of Darien, and on protested checks given by the Bank of Darien, to take up the bills of said Bank. Your Committee cannot perceive the difference between such judgments; they equally affect the State and

<page id="GA1847.1.P305" no="GA1847.1.307" />

demand settlement by the State of Georgia on the same terms.</p><p>Your Committee believe that it would be the true interest of the State of Georgia to appoint a Commissioner to report to the next Legislature the names and classes of all creditors, and what sum per centum they are ready and willing to receive on final settlement.</p><p>In conclusion, your Committee recommend the adoption of the following resolutions, viz:</p><p><list><item><p>1. <i>Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of Georgia,</i> That the Central Bank do pay over to the judgment creditors of the Bank of Darien, according to priority of the same, the sum of $7,252 30, the net balance, after deducting expenses for winding up the same, and deliver to them in the same manner the good assets yet remaining, on account of their judgments.</p></item><item><p>2. <i>Resolved,</i> That the Director of the Central Bank be instructed to report to the next Legislature the names and classes of all creditors of the Bank of Darien, who in the opinion of said Director are bona fide creditors.</p></item><item><p>3. <i>Resolved,</i> That his Excellency the Governor be authorized and requested to appoint, at his earliest convenience, a suitable agent, residing in Mississippi, to sell and dispose of the lands held by the Darien Bank in the State of Mississippi, to turn over the proceeds thereof to the officers of the Central Bank.</p></item></list></p><p>Agreed to, December 28, 1847.</p><p>ANDREW J.

Echols.</shorttitle><p>The sad news of the demise of Col. Robert M. Echols of Georgia, who was in command of the 13th Regiment of the United States Infantry, in the war with Mexico, falls upon our ear in a manner to produce the most painful emotions. Indeed, the tale of death is at all times, and under all circumstances, a solemn tale; and if we can be made serious, no one thing contributes more to make us so. But when we remember that the deceased was for twenty-five out of twenty-seven years last past an active and prominent member in the law-making councils of his native State, Georgia, and most of those years in this Senate Chamber, and often the honored and honorable presiding officer of the Senate; yea, and when we remember that this worthy and dignified Senator has so often measured arms, in manly political strife, upon this floor, with some of us who are now members of the Senate, it may be well said his death produces the most melancholy emotions. This is not all. His native State having full faith and confidence in his prudence, valor, conduct and fidelity, generously bestowed upon him the highest military place. Gen. Echols, unwilling to rust out, at the time of life when not legally subject to the military call of the country gallantly buckled on his armor in a subordinate office, took his place at the head of his Regiment, and while in the active and faithful discharge of his duty became the victim of disease and death, and is now buried in the land of enemies. We say, these reminiscences make his death peculiarly a melancholy event.</p><p>As an expression of our esteem for Col. Robert M. Echols of Georgia, and in order to show a becoming regard for his memory</p>

This, however, cannot, with the views of the duty entertained by your Committee, be done. It occurs to your Committee, that if Florida entertains the same desire that is felt by Georgia for a permanent boundary line being marked as speedily as practicable, with a view to the proper enforcement of the criminal and civil laws of each State, without conflict with those of the other, she will readily unite in referring such points of dispute as may be stated and agreed upon by the Governors of each State respectively, to the decision of the Supreme Court of the U. States. This course is suggested from the fact that cases of disputed boundary between States are confided by the Constitution of the United States to that tribunal; and we cannot but believe that the kind feeling for each other of the two States interested, will promptly lead them to an amicable settlement upon an agreed case of such abstract questions as may be deemed preliminary to the demarcation of the line.</p><p>Your Committee would recommend the submission by the two States to the Supreme Court of the United States, of the abstract question, whether so much of the treaty of the United States of America with Spain in 1795 as provides for the ascertainment and establishment of a boundary between Georgia and Spain, has been executed in pursuance of the terms of said treaty. Should the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States determine that so much of the said treaty as relates to the boundary aforesaid had been executed by the Commissioners of the United States

<page id="GA1847.1.P316" no="GA1847.1.318" />

and Spain, that then the Governor of Georgia appoint two Commissioners, to unite with an equal number on the part of Florida, to mark the line between Georgia and Florida, from Ellicott's Mound to the junction of the Flint with the [Illegible Text] river.</p><p>In the event, however, of the decision of that Court that a boundary has not been ascertained and established between Georgia and Spain, in pursuance of the provisions of the treaty of 1795, the Governor of Georgia is hereby requested to open a correspondence with the Governor of Florida, and to request his co-operation by the appointment of a commission, equal in number, on the part of both States, and that they be authorized to cause examinations to be made for the ascertainment of the head of the St. Marys river, which when made the boundary line shall be run from the head of the St. Marys river, so ascertained, to the junction of the Flint and Chattahoochee rivers.</p><p>Your Committee, in thus recommending a mode for the adjustment of this long standing controversy, would by no means limit the discretion of the Executive as to the points or questions to be submitted, with the concurrence of Florida, to the decision of the Supreme Court. We recommend that the Governor take any and all such steps to close this controversy in an amicable manner, as his judgment may dictate.</p><p>And with a view of furnishing to our sister Florida the evidence of our feelings in this matter,</p><p><i>Be it resolved,</i> That the Governor be requested to transmit to the Governor of Florida a copy of this report and resolution.</p><p>CHARLES J.
