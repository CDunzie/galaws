Captain Raven was born in England, and was a graduate of the Military College at Addiscome. Emigrating to America, he was married to a lady in Charleston; S. C., where he embarked and was engaged in commercial pursuits, at the beginning of the war. Without a formal transfer of allegiance, he generously espoused the cause of the South; and has, with unremitting industry and devotion, given to her the benefit of his labors and scientific training. He did creditable service in South Carolina, but learning the great need of engineers in Georgia, tendered his services to the authorities of this State. As one of the volunteer Staff of the Adjutant General, in the capacity of engineer, he has by his skill, energy and fidelity, secured honorable mention in the last report of that Officer; he has been suddenly stricken down by disease, contracted in the service of the State, in the very flush of his early manhood.

Acts 18623, pages 2528, and 1412, also pages 19,21 of this Pam., from which it will be seen, that for violations of the various Acts on distillation, not only are the stills to be seized and confiscated, but the parties are liable to be indicted and punished, by fines not less than $500 and may be imprisoned at the discretion of the Court, not exceeding 12 months for every offence. It will further appear, that no person can distil for himself or another, or for a county, or the Confederate government, under any contract or agreement, without a license from the Governor of this State. The Goveornor has an enlarged discretion by the provisions of the law, and has charged the Aids-de-Camp in their respective military districts with vigilant attention and prompt action in cases of actual or supposed violations, but this does not relieve, in the least degree, the obligation of every civil officer, whose duty it is now made by solemn enactment, to be vigilant and firm, and to make report in all cases, where there are palpable acts of violations, or circumstances which seem suspicious of the same; whilst it is equally the duty of all good citizens to give an active and earnest co-operation.</p><pre>COMPILER.<br set="RIGHT" /></pre></footnote></fulltitle><p>1.

<page id="GA1863.1.P142" no="GA1863.1.153" />

or things to be seized. And this conclusion results from the two following reasons: First, because the power to suspend the writ is derived, not from express delegation, but only from implication, which must always yield to express, conflicting and restricting words. Second, because this power, being found no where in the Constitution but in words which are copied from the original Constitution of the United States, as adopted in 1787, must yield in all points of conflict to the subsequent amendments of 1789, which are also copied into our present Constitution, and which contain the prohibitions above quoted, and were adopted with the declared purpose of adding further declaratory and restrictive clauses. <sidenote>[Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] the constitutional limitations on the power to suspend the writ of habeas corpus.</sidenote> <sidenote>Reasons given.</sidenote></p><p>2nd. That due process of law for seizing the persons of the people, as defined by the Constitution itself, is a warrant issued upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the persons to be seized, and the issuing of such warrants being the exertion of a Judicial power, is, if done by any branch of the government except the Judiciary, a plaim violation of that provision of the Constitution which vests the Judicial power in the Courts alone; and therefore all seizures of the persons of the people, by any officer of the Confederate Government, without warrant, and all warrants for that purpose from any but a Judicial source, are, in the judgment of this General Assembly, unreasonable and unconstitutional. <sidenote>Seizure of persons can only be made on probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, particularly describing the persons to be seized; and the Courts along can issue warrants for such seizures.</sidenote></p><p>3rd. That the recent act of Congress to suspend the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> in cases of arrests ordered by the President, Secretary of War, or General officer commanding the Trans-Mississippi Military Department, is an attempt to sustain the military authority in the exercise of the constitutional, Judicial function of issuing warrants, and to give validity to unconstitutional seizures of the persons of the people; and as the said act, by its express terms, confines its operation to the upholding of this class of unconstitutional seizures, the whole suspension attempted to be authorized by it, and the whole act itself, in the judgment of this General Assembly, are unconstitutional. <sidenote>Late act of Congress declared unconstitutional.</sidenote></p><p>4th. That, in the judgment of this General Assembly, the said act is a dangerous assault upon the constitutional power of the Courts, and upon the liberty of the people, and beyond the power of any possible necessity to justify it; and while our Senators and Representatives in Congress are earnestly urged to take the first possible opportunity to have it repealed, we refer the question of its validity to the Courts, with the hope, that the people and the military authorities will abide by the decision. <sidenote>As a dangerous and unjustitable measure, our members in Congress urged to insist on its immediate repeal.</sidenote> <sidenote>In the meantime, its validity referted to the Courts.</sidenote></p><p>5th. That, as constitutional liberty is the sole object which our people and our noble army have, in our present terrible struggle with the Government of Mr. Lincoln, so also is a faithful adherence to it on the part of our own Government, through good fortune in arms, and through bad, one of the greatest elements of our strength and final success; because the constant contrast of

<page id="GA1863.1.P143" no="GA1863.1.154" />

constitutional Government on our part, with the usurpations and tyrannies, which characterize the Government of our enemy, under the ever recurring and ever false plea of the necessities of war, will have the double effect of animating our people with an unconquerable zeal, and of inspiring the people of the North more and more, with a desire and determination to put an end to a contest which is waged by their Government openly against <i>our</i> liberty and as truly, but more covertly, against their own. <sidenote>Constitutional liberty declared to be our great end and purpose by the war, and prime element of our strength.</sidenote></p><approvaldate>Approved March 19th, 1864.</approvaldate></law><law id="R1863V1N149" initial.page="154"><lawnbr>(No. 40.)</lawnbr><fulltitle><i>A Resolution expresive of the confidence of this General Assembly in the integrity and patriotism of President Davis.</i></fulltitle><p><i>Resolved,</i> That notwithstanding the difference of opinion entertained by members of this Legislature in reference to the wisdom and constitutionality of the recent Act of Congress suspending the privilege of the writ of <i>Habeas Corpus,</i> the General Assembly of Georgia hereby express our undiminished confidence in the integrity and patriotism of Jefferson Davis, Chiet Magistrate of the Confederate States. <sidenote>Declaratory of undiminished confidence in the patriotism  integrity of President Davis.</sidenote></p><approvaldate>Assented to 19 March, 1864.</approvaldate></law><law id="R1863V1N150" initial.page="154"><lawnbr>(No. 41.)</lawnbr><p><i>Resolved, by the General Assembly of the State of Georgia,</i> That our Senators and Representatives in Congress, be requested to use their influence in having the mail route between Dublin, in Laurens County, and Mount Vernon, in Montgomery county, re-established; and that the Governor cause a copy of this resolution to be sent to each of our Senators and Representatives in Congress. <sidenote>Re-establishment of mailroute between Dublin and Mt.

That the best possible commentary upon this grand text [Illegible Text] our fathers of 1776, is their accompanying action, which it was put forth to justify; and that action was the immortal declaration that the former political connection between the Colonies and the State of Great Britain, was dissolved and the thirteen Colonies were, and of right, ought to be, not one independent State, [Illegible Text] thirteen independent States, each of them being such a people as had the right, whenever they chose to exercise it, to separate themselves from a political association and government of their [Illegible Text] choice, and institute a new government to suit themselves. <sidenote>The Declaration of Independence the result of this principle.</sidenote></p><p>3rd. That if Rhode Island, with her meagre elements of nationality, was such a people in 1776, when her separation from [Illegible Text] government and people of Great Britain took place, much more was Georgia and each of the other seceding States, with the large territories, populations and resources, such a people, [Illegible Text]

<page id="GA1863.1.P146" no="GA1863.1.157" />

untitled to exercise the same right in 1861, when they decreed their separation from the Government and people of the United States; and if the separation was rightful in the first case, it was [Illegible Text] clearly so in the last, the right depending, as it does in the case of every people for whom it is claimed, simply upon their [Illegible Text] and their will to constitute an independent State. <sidenote>Georgia and the seceded States declared such a people as were entitled to exeroise the right of self government.</sidenote></p><p>4th. That this right was perfect in each of the States to be exercised by her at her own pleasure, without challenge or resistance from any other power whatsoever; and while these Southern states had long had reason enough to justify its assertion against some of their faithless associates, yet, remembering the dictate of prudence that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes, they forbore a resort to [Illegible Text] exercise, until numbers of the Northern States, State after [Illegible Text] through a series of years, and by studied legislation, had [Illegible Text] themselves in open hostility against an acknowledged provision of the Constitution, and had at last succeeded in the election [Illegible Text] a President who was the avowed exponent and executioner of their faithless designs against the Constitutional rights of their [Illegible Text] sistersrights which had been often adjudicated by the [Illegible Text] and which were never denied by the abolitionists themselves, but upon the ground that the Constitution itself was void whenever it came in conflict with a higher law which they [Illegible Text] not find among the laws of God, and which depended, for [Illegible Text] exposition, solely upon the elastic consciences of rancorous [Illegible Text] The Constitution thus broken, and deliberately and [Illegible Text] repudiated by several of the States who were parties it, ceased, according to universal law, to be binding on any [Illegible Text] the rest, and those States who had been wronged by the reach, were justified in using their rights to provide new guards or their future security. <sidenote>The causes of separation stated, and the act of secession justified.</sidenote></p><p>5th. That the reasons which justified the separation when it [Illegible Text] place, have been vindicated and enhanced in force by the subsequent course of the Government of Mr. Lincolnby his [Illegible Text] rejection of the Confederate Commissioners who were sent to Washington before the war, to settle all matters of difference without a resort to arms, thus evincing his determination to have war: by his armed occupation of the territory of the [Illegible Text] States, and especially by his treacherous attempt to [Illegible Text] his garrisons in their midst, after they had, in pursuance [Illegible Text] their right, withdrawn their people and territory from the [Illegible Text] of his government, thus rendering war a necessity, and [Illegible Text] inaugurating the present lamentable war: by his official [Illegible Text] of the Confederate States, as rebel and disloyal [Illegible Text] for their rightful withdrawal from their faithless associate [Illegible Text] whilst no word of censure has ever fallen from him against [Illegible Text] faithless States who were truly disloyal to the Union and [Illegible Text] Constitution, which was the only cement of the Union, and who were the true authors of all the wrong and all the mischief

<page id="GA1863.1.P147" no="GA1863.1.158" />

of the separation, thus insulting the innocent by charging upon them the crimes of his own guilty allies: And finally, by his monstrous usurpations of power and undisguised repudiation of the Constitution, and his mocking scheme of securing a <i>Republican</i> form of government to sovereign States by putting nine-tenths of the people under the dominion of one-tenth, who may be abject enough to swear allegiance to his usurpation, thus betraying his design to subvert true constitutional republicanism in the North as well as the South. <sidenote>The separation originally just, vindicated by the subsequent policy of Mr. Lineoln.</sidenote></p><p>6th. That while we regard the present war between these Confederate States and the United States as a huge crime, whose beginning and continuance are justly chargeable to the government of our enemy, yet we do not hesitate to affirm that, if our own government, and the people of both governments, would avoid all participation in the guilt of its continuance, it becomes all of them, on all proper occasions, and in all proper waysthe people acting through their State organizations and popular assemblies, and our government through its appropriate departmentsto use their earnest efforts to put an end to this unnatural, unchristian and savage work of carnage and havoc. And to this end, we earnestly recommend that our government, immediately after signal successes of our arms, and on other occasions, when none can impute its action to alarm, instead of a sincere desire for peace, shall make to the government of our enemy, an official offer of peace, on the basis of the great principle declared by our common fathers in 1776, accompanied by the distinct expression of a willingness, on our part, to follow that principle to its true logical consequences, by agreeing that any border State, whose preference for our association may be doubted, (doubts having been expressed as to the wishes of the border States) shall settle the question for herself, by a Convention, to be elected for that purpose, after the withdrawal of all military forces, of both sides, from her limits. <sidenote>An honorable close of the war highly desirable.</sidenote> <sidenote>After signal success of our arms, and on all appropriate occagions, terms of peace should be officially tendered the enemy on the great principles of 1776, and in pursuance of it, the border States allowed to make free choice of future association.</sidenote></p><p>7th. That we believe this course, on the part of our government, would constantly weaken, and sooner or later, break down the war power of our enemy, by showing to his people the justice of our cause, our willingness to make peace on the principles of 1776, and the shoulders on which rests the responsibility for the continuance of the unnatural strife; that it would be hailed by our people and citizen soldiery, who are bearing the brunt of the war, as an assurance that peace will not be unnecessarily delayed, nor their sufferings unnecessarily prolonged; and that it would be regretted by nobody on either side, except men whose importance, or whose gains, would be diminished by peace and men whose ambitious designs would need cover under the ever-recurring [Illegible Text] of the necessities of war. <sidenote>Reasons of policy for this course.</sidenote></p><p>8th.
