Your committee believe it to be a just claim; but as firmly believe the obligation for its discharge rests with the General Government. The refusal to satisfy these claims cannot but be a matter of great regret, if not surprise, to Georgia. If there is any one consideration more than another, that entitles the Federal Government to our respect and admiration, it is the uniform good faith with which it has always complied with its [Illegible Text] Indeed it is proverbial for this estimable trait, and the unbounded credit which it [Illegible Text] in all [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] taansactions, affords ample proof of the factBut your committee are constrained

<page id="GA1826.1.P180" no="GA1826.1.189" />

to believe, that in this instance of these claims, there is a departure from this elevated and wonted character, doubtless resulting, not from design, but from an improper understanding of their true merits. Georgia was one of the first States that readily and heartily entered into the Union under the present Federal Constitution, adopted as will be recollected in the year 1787. In that constitution the States yielded the right to the General Government to regulate and conduct the whole military force of the [Illegible Text] and specially to call forth the militia to execute the laws of the Union, to suppress insurrections and repel invasions. This was not all, the constitution tied up the hands of the States from the hostile use of arms, or the engaging in war, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent [Illegible Text] as will not admit of delay. By which, every one must at once perceive, there was an undoubted pledge to protect the States. The General Government was to repel [Illegible Text] but when her immediate aid could not be had, and necessity of defence became so urgent as to admit of no delay, then the States were authorised to fight for themselvesBut it must be obvious the General Government could not be released from the obligation to pay the expenses, as when the States, from inevitable necessity, were compelled to protect themselves, as when the invasions were repelled by the General Government itself Protection was due from her, by contract, the allowing the States to do it, in particular instances, was only a modification of the manner of affording that protection, leaving her still bound to discharge the cost. The situation of the States, especially the frontier ones, rendered them peculiarly liable to invasions, and from the then recent troubles, as well as the character of the enemy from which invasion might be expected, there can be but little doubt that the very case upon which these claims are founded, was fully in the eye of the Convention, when the Constitution was framed.</p><p>From the moment of the adoption of this constitution, while many of the States, from their internal situation, were rapidly improving in population and wealth, the State of Georgia as every one knows, was subjected to a constant harrassing invasion from this exterminating enemy. The growth of the State was retarded, the progress of improvement was arrested, the arts of industry were suspended, and the whole frontier four hundred miles in extent, presented a scene of the most heart chilling massacres and desolating ravages. These bloody and waste-laying depredations could no longer be repelled by the voluntary exertions of the frontier settlers, who alone for years, without the aid of either State or General Government, withstood these destructive incursions, and had nevertheless greatly extended the settlements of the country. At length a crisis arrived when the frontier had to be abandoned or defended, by a different force from that which had constituted its former support, and in the year ninety-two, but five years after the Federal Government had guaranteed protection against invading enemies, the State of Georgia was constrained to call out her militia, not only under the express authority of that instrument as contained within the exception above expressed, but by the explicit and now well established direction of General Washington, then President of the United States. Every one knows this militia was composed of poor men, they were in constant and

<page id="GA1826.1.P181" no="GA1826.1.190" />

highly useful service, they were so long in service as to lose the means of support by their honest labour, and their families were deprived of the supplies which usually result from farming pursuits. These are the facts that constitute the claim of the Georgia MilitiaThere is something [Illegible Text] hard in taking from a State the right to use its military force, except in certain cases, compel the State to contribute to the maintenance of that force under the direction of the General Government, and in a few years after having pledged the national faith to give protection, to see that State suffer the most unspeakable injuries from murderous invasions, and refuse her satisfaction for repelling them with her own force, and that force used too by every right that could sanctify its exercise. It is this view of the case which has authorised your committee to intimate the appearance of a want of good faith on the part of the General Government, not however designing to charge the same as by any means wilful or intentional. Your committee therefore recommend the following resolution:</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That Congress be respectfully requested to take the Georgia Militia claims once more under their serious consideration, and to afford the relief which seems, as Georgia would with great deference alledge, to be so justly due to those individuals who defended the frontier of this State against the invasions of the Indians, at a time when the emergency would not admit of delay, and when the General Government was not prepared to afford the support and protection contemplated by the constitution, but was afterwards approved and confirmed by them, and that his excellency the Governor be requested to take measures to have this application submitted to Congress.</p><approvaldate>Approved, 20th Dec. 1826.</approvaldate></law><law id="R1826V1N193" initial.page="190"><p>IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 19th December, 1826.</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That the General Assembly approve the measures already taken by his Excellency the Governor, and that he be authorised and [Illegible Text] to employ and put in service any of the military force of this State he may deem proper, to repel the invasion made by the Indians upon the frontier settlements of this State and to give complete protection to the same.</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That his Excellency the Governor be requested to dispatch without delay an express to the Little Prince, of the Creek Nation,

the means of usefulness your committee do not consider it essential they should advert. For all needful purposes, it is sufficient to remark, that from the commencement of collegiate operations in 1802, to the [Illegible Text] of a land, for a money endowment in 1816, insuperable difficulties were encountered, and but few fruits produced. The sale of the College Lands amounted to the sum of one hundred and twenty seven thousand dollars. This sum, secured by [Illegible Text] and mortgage, being placed in your [Illegible Text], induced on the part of the Legislature, the grant of one hundred thousand dollars in the stock of the State Bank With the outfit, thus beneficially provided, the College in 1817, commenced its course of progressive improvement. With the prosperity of the times, it flourished until 1822, and then with their depression, it would have sunk, but for the sustaining influence of the public liberality. The legislature of that year, placed the institution beyond the fluctuations of commerce and of bank dividends, by providing a permanent endowment of eight thousand dollars. With this sum, and the avails of tuition, the operations of the College are conducted by a Faculty consisting of a President, Professor of Natural Philosophy and Botany, Professor of Chemistry and Mineralogy, Professor of Mathematics, Professor of Ethics and Belles Lettres, and two Tutors. By the enumeration of the members composing this Faculty, your committee are led to examine another topic referred to them through the legislature, by the Senatus Academicus which lately closed its session at the seat of government. That board exercises a superintendance over the whole of the literary concerns of the [Illegible Text], and has passed a Resolve, That it was expedient and proper, to solicit from the General Assembly, an annual appropriation of twelve hundred dollars, to be applied exclusively to the establishment of a Professorship of Modern Languages in Franklin College in the University of Georgia.</p><p>Coming as this resolution does, from a body so distinguished and enlightened as the Senatus Academicus, your committee cannot permit themselves to question the <i>expediency</i> or <i>[Illegible Text]</i> of the application. They yield to it a more willing [Illegible Text], when they come to compare the professorships in Franklin College with those of other Colleges not more mature in age or extensive in usefulness. To give effect therefore to the application of the Senatus A [Illegible Text], your committee have submitted herewith a [Illegible Text] resolution.</p><p>The funds heretofore set apart for the endowment of county academies, and for the [Illegible Text] and support of free schoolsThe manner in which these funds have been applied, and the effects produced, next demand the examination of your committee.</p><p>The school fund consists of five hundred thousand dollars, and is made up of,</p><table><tr align="LEFT" valign="TOP"><td><i>S</i>tock of the Bank of Darien,</td><td align="RIGHT">$200 000</td></tr><tr align="LEFT" valign="TOP"><td><i>S</i>tock of the State Bank,</td><td align="RIGHT">200 000</td></tr><tr align="LEFT" valign="TOP"><td><i>S</i>tock of the Bank of Augusta,</td><td align="RIGHT">100,000</td></tr><tr align="LEFT" valign="TOP"><td /><td align="RIGHT">$500,000</td></tr></table>

<p>The several acts which have been passed upon the subject of county academies, commencing with the charter of the University in 1785, and terminating in 1824, obviously contemplate an efficient endowment of at least one academy in each county. With this view, that charter made each county academy a branch of the University, and subjected them to supervision accordingly. In furtherance of this view also, was the act of [Illegible Text] and Amercement in 1792, authorising commissioners from [Illegible Text] county, to purchase in confiscated property to the amount of one thousand pounds.</p><p>The aid contemplated from this source, was uncertain and [Illegible Text], even in the hands of the most fortunate, and with many, was wholly inoperative. The amounts realised were small, and in but few [Illegible Text] beneficially applied. The present existing laws have affixed an estimate to this intended munificence, by holding the intended beneficiaries accountable for only one eighth of their [Illegible Text] purchases. Under the new scheme of endowment now in progress, the older counties have been made to account for their ancient purchases. An equal participation in the fund distributed in 1824 and 1825, has been denied them, that they might be brought to an equality with their younger sisters, and then draw equally from the common parent, until the receipts of each should amount to the sum of two thousand dollars. This being effected, each county will be considered as specifically endowed, and thenceforward the profits of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars in bank stock will be distributable amongst all the counties in the State, in proportion to their representation. For the last political year ending on the 1st day of November, the distributive share amounted to the sum of $215 38. This is receivable at the Treasury upon the joint application of the Trustees of the incorporated academies in each county, and to be divided between them in proportion to the number of scholars usually taught in each. For a policy thus enlightened, and a munificence thus liberal, no further requittal is demanded on the part of the State than that the participants of her bounty should keep a just and accurate account of the [Illegible Text] in which the same should be disbursed and applied, and make report thereof annually through the Senatus Academicus to the legislature. The <i>Propriety</i> of such report is dictated by a sense of obligation; but its <i>necessity</i> is the positive requirement of the law. But notwithstanding these things are so, your [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] to state, that in the range which they have taken through the several reports made by the Senators to the Senatus [Illegible Text], they discover but [Illegible Text] traces of that particularity required by law, and which is so essential to a due course of [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] a subject so important. It was not to have been expected that any [Illegible Text] of endowment, [Illegible Text] a new and varying population, [Illegible Text] have made any near approach to perfection. Hence the [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text], [Illegible Text], [Illegible Text] information, not only from each county, but from the [Illegible Text] of the incorporated academies in the State. Information short of this would be short of the laws already in force, and insufficient to enable the State to dispense her practical and well aimed aids, and enforce due accountability on the part of her agents. To enforce a compliance with the laws in this regard, your committee beg leave to accompany this report with a resolution, which they hope may be adopted.</p>

<p><i>Resolved,</i> That [Illegible Text] trustees or commissioners of any incorporated academy, shall hereafter be [Illegible Text] to draw [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] from the treasury of this State, until they shall have presented a [Illegible Text] and fair [Illegible Text] of the manner in which all sums previously drawn shall have been disbursed; and that his excell [Illegible Text] the Governor be requested to enforce strictly the provisions of this resolution. <i>Provided,</i> this resolution shall not debar the right to receive dividends heretofare declared.</p><p>The subject of free schools for the education of poor children, has also been referred to the examination of your committee.</p><p>By the act of 1821, before referred to, poor schools were intended to be endowed by the profits of the one half of the school fund, which has already been [Illegible Text] to consist of an half million of dollars. Instead, however, of confining [Illegible Text] department to [Illegible Text] distributive share of the bank dividends, it has found [Illegible Text] better provision and safer reliance in the increased liberality of the Legislature, expressed in an act of [Illegible Text]. This sets apart the sum of twenty thousand dollars, to be [Illegible Text] annually amongst the different counties of this <i>S</i>tate, in proportion to the number of free white population in each county Your committee have annexed [Illegible Text] a tabular statement, shewing the population of each county, and the amount which they are entitled to receive, respectively. The sums thus provided, have been eagerly sought after, but the evidence of [Illegible Text] in their application, and utility in their [Illegible Text], has not been furnished in a manner satisfactory to the minds of your committee. From some counties, imperfect reports have been receivedfrom others, no reports at all. The several agents may have been faithfulIf they have, the fact should have been made appear, as well for their own credit as for the needed information of the legislatureIf they have not, then the information was the more necessary, to enable the legislature to apply the corrective. In the absence of such information, your committee are unable to determine whether the benefits intended by a [Illegible Text] so kindly and so amply bestowed, have been, or are likely to be realised. The subject is one of great interest and complexity, and of novel introduction among our citizens. Your committee have been directed to enquire into the system as it now exists, and to report a more complete system suited to the state of our funds and the number and exigencies of our population. Such a work would require more deliberation [Illegible Text] your committee have had it in their power to bestow, and a more thorough and extended knowledge of facts, than they have had it in their power to obtain. It is a work however, well worthy the legislator and philanthropist, of grateful performance, and fraught with the most lasting benefits to an interesting portion of dependent population. In order, therefore, that it may be subjected to the deliberation which it merits, and such report made as shall be as available as practicable, and furnish the grounds of future legislation, your committee submit a further resolution.</p><p>The subject of free schools in this State, being one of the first importance to the community in general, and to a dependent portion of our population in particular, and no system having been yet formed

<page id="GA1826.1.P187" no="GA1826.1.196" />

and digested, securing fidelity in the management of the funds, and usefulness in their disbursement.</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That Messrs. Campbell, Hull, of Clark, and Holt, of [Illegible Text] be, and they are hereby appointed a committee; and they are requested by the General Assembly to digest and report a plan of free schools suited to the condition of the poor school fund, and of the dependant population of the state. And to enable said committee to proceed efficiently in the discharge of its duty, the executive and other officers of the state are requested to afford to said committee all the information and facilities in [Illegible Text] powerSaid report to be made to the next session of the legislature.</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That in all cases in which any county, by its agent, may heretofore have drawn any portion of the poor school fund, and shall not have made a full, distinct, and detailed return of the manner in which such fund so drawn has been disbursed, it shall not be lawful for such county to draw any further portion of such fund, [Illegible Text] full report shall have been made, according to the [Illegible Text] in force upon this subject shall have been fully complied withAnd that his Excellency the Governor be requested to have this resolution strictly enforced</p><p><i>And it is further Resolved,</i> That nothing in the foregoing resolution shall debar any county from drawing dividends heretofore declared, either on the funds of county [Illegible Text] or poor schools.</p><p>Returning again to the subject of county academies, your committee repeat their convictions of the necessity of giving to them increased encouragement and energies. It is from these, that teachers are to be mainly drawn for supply of the schools in other sections of the counties. If it be the fact, that education must descend, then it is necessary that the source should not only be high, but that it should be pure. The only means of producing these ends, are to be found in a course of enlightened policy and liberal benefaction on the part of the State. Under the most flourishing condition of the funds heretofore set apart, their profits were inadequate; but now that the aids derived from the Darien Bank have failed entirely, and those from the State Bank have been greatly diminished, your committee see every necessity of supplying the deficiency. This may be done by [Illegible Text] apart the stock which may hereafter be taken by the State in the Bank of Macon, or in the increased funds of the Bank of Augusta. To secure this object, your committee submit a further resolution.</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That any stock which may hereafter be subscribed for, or taken by the State in the Bank of Macon, or in the increased stock of the Bank of Augusta, that the same be set apart and added to the stock composing the school fund of the State, and that the dividends thereof be distributed accordingly.</p>

<page id="GA1826.1.P198" no="GA1826.1.207" />

the negatiation with the Cherokee Indians with a view to extinguish the title to the lands in their possession within the limits of GeorgiaAnd also of enquiring into the propriety of requesting the General Government to propose a treaty allowing the Indians reservations, not to exceed one-sixth of the territory acquired, subject to be afterwards purchased for the use of Georgia.</p><p>Upon the best reflection which the committee have been able to bestow upon this subject, they entertain an opinion which is without division among them, that the extinguishment of the Indian title to all the lands within the limits of Georgia is a matter of not only constant, but urgent expediency. This question has been so repeatedly presented to the general government, and the wishes of the state pressed upon its attention under such a diversity of aspects, as to render, at this time, a detailed exhibit of its views entirely unnecessary. It would seem that little else was required to be said, than what would serve to relieve the general government of whatever solicitude might be felt, from having a subjact so often and so importunately brought to its consideration. The respect which the state owes itself, and which it certainly entertains for the general government would, in courtesy, require the declaration that whatever else may be thought to belong to this application, nothing is further from its intention, than a spirit of captiousness or a restless impatience under repeated disappointments. The state has always believed its claim perfectly just, and acting under the honest confidence which unquestionable right never fails to inspire, it acknowledges that every occasion has been sought openly, but frankly, to avow that no demand could be better fortified with motives for its speedy satisfaction, than that which we have so long and so abortively urged, and therefore, the frequency of our attempts to bring this matter to a final adjustment.</p><p>If now, by adding another essay to those which have gone before, and which have proved so untoward in their issue, any thing of clamor or resentful discontent should be supposed to exist in this appeal, we are ready to give the assurance that nothing can be more foreign from its temper, and in a fair interpretation of its design, nothing could be more widely misunderstood. We believe that circumstances of recent origin in the Cherokee Nation, which, from prudential considerations, need not now be mentioned, render at this time, another effort to obtain the country, more auspicious than any which have heretofore been made, or which can hereafter be made, with any well grounded hope of success, if the present occasion is permitted to pass away unimproved. But when to these indications, so highly favoring the view of a prosperous negotiation, there is added, as we conceive, the influence and effect which extensive reserves are calculated to have among Indians of a certain character, little doubt is entertained of a result altogether satisfactory to the reasonable wishes of GeorgiaTo the general government possessed, as it is, of a full knowledge of the state and condition of the Indian Nation, the power and avarice of certain characters who control its affairs, and the causes which have hitherto thwarted the measures designed to fulfil her engagement with Georgia, it cannot be necessary to suggest the efficient

Blount, Crawford, and Hamilton, the commissioners, accompanied by a skilful Mathematician, the Engineer of the State, a Surveyor, and a competent number of labourers, and every way prepared to execute the purpose of their appointment, attended at the time and place previously agreed on by the Governor's of the respective States, and were met by one only of the commissioners on the part of AlabamaAs the attending commissioner from Alabama declined while his colleage was absent, to enter into a discussion as to the place from which the line should commence, (the only point of difficulty), it was agreed to run a random line from a bend in the Chattahoochie near Fort Mitchell, to Nickajack, when it was [Illegible Text] every thing preliminary to the actual demarcation of the line would be adjusted.</p><p>This random line was run, and at Nickajack, (the absent commissioner of Alabama having arrived,) an exchange of powers by the respective parties took place, and a discussion was entered into on the subject of the exact point of departure from the Chattahoochie.</p><p>It had been ascertained by actual survey in running the random line, that the first great bend in the river next above the mouth of the Uchee, from which a right line would run to Nickajack without touching the river, was the Big Shoal or Miller's Bend, and this the commissioners on the part of Georgia contended, was the bend at which the line should begin. The commissioners of Alabama considered the Uchee as an unimportant circumstance in ascertaining the point of departure, insisted on the great bend where the direction of the river is changed from South west to south, as the place of beginning, and rested their arguments on the facts that the Cussetah and Coweta towns are above the Uchee, and that above Miller's Bend and below the great bend named by them, there is a stream emptying into the Chattahoochie on the western side called the We-hut kee, said best to answer the description of Uchee [Illegible Text] in the Artitles of Cession.</p>

<page id="GA1826.1.P201" no="GA1826.1.210" />

<p>This discussion being continued for some time, and it being pretty well ascertained that neither party would recede from the position assumed, the commissioners of Georgia gave notice to those of labama, that they should terminate a conference which was likely to prove so fruitless, and proceed to run the line to the Big Shoal or Miller's Bend, which they accordingly did, unaccompanied by the commissioners of Alabama. It is deeply to be regretted, that there should exist such ambiguity in the Articles of Cession, as to leave any doubt on the subject of boundary, a subject in which the least uncertainty is always embarrassing; but your committee believe this ambiguity which evidently arose from the imperfect knowledge had by the commissioners who negotiated the Cession of eighteen hundred and two of the topography of the country through which the line was to run, and of the relative situation of Nickajack and the other extreme of the line, is not so great but that the meaning of the parties to that instrument may be arrived at with sufficient certainty.</p><p>Previous to the cession of 1802, the western limit of Georgia was the Mississippi river, but the people of Georgia contemplating a sale to the United States of a part of their western territory, and desirous of fixing permanently the bounds which should limit the power of the legislature to sell or dispose of their territory, and of establishing permanently the boundaries of the State, carefully expressed in the Constitution of seventeen hundred and ninety-eight what those limits and boundaries should be.</p><p>By a reference to the twenty-third section of the first article of the Constitution, it is seen that the whole of the Chattahoochie is reserved to Georgia. This which is the supreme law of the State, must have been known to the commissioners who negotiated the cession of eighteen hundred and two, and it is fair to presume reference was had to it, for we find that though they depart from the authority and power given by the acts of 1799 and 1800 on that subject, yet they adhere to the provisions of the Constitution, and cautiously preserve to Georgia the whole of the Chattahoochie river. The commissioners in their negotiations having pursued a medium course between what was prescribed by the acts of 1799 and 1800, and regarded the Constitution under which those acts were passed, may be presumed apart from all other evidence to have intended the line to leave the Chattahoochie at the first point above the mouth of Uchee creek, from which it would run to Nickajack without touching the river, as the line must be a straight line; and from the survey made, it appears that Miller's or the Big Shoal bend is that pointThat a bend still lower down the river and in the neighborhood of Fort Mitchell was supposed to be that point, and the bend designed by the commissioners, [Illegible Text] from the concurrent testimony and assent for more than twenty years of all those best acquainted with the country through which the line was to run, and with the negotiation between the United States and Georgia. That the great bend where the river changes its general direction, or the general western bend, or the most western [Illegible Text] as it is frequently called was not designed, is apparent from thisThat this bend was well known and named as one of the points of limit in the act of 1799, which act was certainly not conformed to

<page id="GA1826.1.P202" no="GA1826.1.211" />

by the commissioners, and the bend named in the articles of cession is designated as if to distinguish it from that bend. The great bend thereof (referring to the Chattahoochie) and next above the place where a certain creek or river called Uchee, being the first considerable stream on the western side above the Cussetah and Coweta towns enters into the Chattahoochie riverNow it is hard to conceive why, if this great or greatest bend, a place well known had been intended, the Uchee creek and the Coweta and Cussetah towns sixty miles distant, should have been referred to more clearly to designate it. From the whole view of the subject, your committee are of the opinion that the line run is the true line, and they entertain too high a respect for the good sense, justice, and magnanimity of the citizens of Alabama, to believe for one moment that a difference of opinion will be entertained by the two States, after the whole grounds of dispute shall have been maturely and deliberately considered by them. Your committee therefore recommend the adoption of the following resolution.</p><p><i>Resolved by</i> t<i>he Senate and House of Representa</i>t<i>ives of the State of Georgia in General Assembly met,</i> That the line run and marked from Nickajack to Miller's Bend on the Chattahoochie, is the true line contemplated by the Articles of Cession of 1802 between the United States and Georgia, and that it be recognised as such by the State of Georgia.</p><approvaldate>Approved 8th Dec. 1826.</approvaldate></law><law id="R1826V1N218" initial.page="211"><p>IN SENATE, 5th December, 1826.</p><p>Whereas, from the smallness of the annual tax of Emanuel county, and the great difficulty on that account of getting any one to collect the same, a practice has obtained in said county of conferring on one and the same person the appointment of both receiver and collector, and suffering said officer to collect two years taxes at the same timeAnd whereas, Charles C.

documents which relate to the Treaties with the Creek Nation of Indians, and our differences with the General Government, have had the same under attentive consideration, and ask leave to make the following Report:</p><p>The unfortunate misunderstanding between the General Government and the State of Georgia, has been marked by features of a peculiar character, and plainly [Illegible Text] a force and power in the former which should have formed the subject of concern, if [Illegible Text], to our sister States. But we regret to say that the very reverse has been the fact, and a cold, if not a [Illegible Text] indifference, has taken the place of much more deserved regard.</p><p>We are not unapprised of the influence of power, nor are we unmindful of the forbearance claimed from weakness; but we did believe that the structure of the Federal Government was such, its foundations so laid, as we fondly hoped, in the best and most generous feelings of the heart, as to have protected a sister State, if not from injury and oppression, at least from unnecessary insult an contempt.</p><p>Your committee speaking, as it sincerely believes, the sentiments of the Legislature of Georgia, cannot but imagine that our wrongs are neither known nor felt, or if [Illegible Text], in so slight a degree, as to be entirely misunderstood by our sister States.Entertaining, as we do, the most exalted veneration for the Union, in [Illegible Text] to its government, and the most unaffected attachment for the states in relation to the kindred affections, interests and habits which bind us together, and believing that these bland relations are wholly reciprocal, we are at a loss to conceive how our repeated complaints have fallen upon the ear of such benevolence with so much apathy, and our remonstrances turned aside with so little concern. It cannot be accounted for upon any other rational principle, than the one which is just suggested.</p><p>It is not now the intention of your committee to betray a clamorous spirit of complaint. The regard which they feel for the dignity and honor of the state they represent, would, of itself, sufficiently admonish them to avoid such a course; but when to this is added the fact, which we can in great truth [Illegible Text], that we have not a single discontent against the Federal Government, considered in relation to its legitimate powers, there can be no necessity to swell our [Illegible Text] beyond the immediate acts, which, as we conceive, have the rather sprung from the abuse, than the exercise of acknowledged right. In the good feeling and [Illegible Text] of the states, we have the most undoubted confidencein the integrity of purpose, honesty of motive, and fidelity of service of the national legislature, we cannot feel one [Illegible Text] emotion. Before that body we believe we can be respectfully heard, and to that body, we as firmly believe the crisis has arrived when it becomes necessary to preter a solemn appeal. And we would premise, in a temper of perfect respect, but of not less decisive earnestness, that it is a sovereign, and not a subject that sues; it is an equal and not an inferior that remonstrates; it is an independent

<page id="GA1826.1.P220" no="GA1826.1.229" />

member of the Union, and not the subordinate creature of a family that complains. It is not for forfeited privileges we supplicate, but we seek the redress of violated rights, and in this, we cannot for a moment suppose, that the States in Congress assembled, could desire to see us approach them in any other manner than that of an open, honest and confident avowal of our grievances.</p><p>The Executive Department of the General Government has, in fact and principle, distinctly asserted, that the states have not the exclusive jurisdiction of the soil within their chartered limits; that the Indians and the territory occupied by them, within the recognised and admitted boundaries of states, originally independent, and so acknowledged by Great Britain, belong to the exclusive management and control of the General Government; and that the States have no right to exercise [Illegible Text] over the one, or interfere with the other. It has not only [Illegible Text] the right to prevent a state from exercising jurisdiction within its limits, but it has given open proof of the fact, that it will become the ally [Illegible Text] the Indians against one of its own family, and will actually wage war in the very bosom of a state, for what, in its own mere [Illegible Text] without regard to the opinion of the opposing state, may be deemed an infraction of the Federal Constitution:Thereby at [Illegible Text] establishing this monstrous [Illegible Text], that the General Government can and will connect itself with foreign nations in acts of hostility to the local measures of the states, and consequently turning their own power and resources against themselves. The principle is avowed, nay, confirmed by the fact, that an [Illegible Text] force may be directly employed against a state, before [Illegible Text] is had to the civil authorities of the government to correct whatever real or imaginary violation of law may be [Illegible Text] to exist; thus using, at once, the strong arm of power in preference to the milder and more moderate course of legal investigation;a resort that deprives the citizen of the valued right of trial, involves the country in all the horrors of war, and can only terminate in the most unspeakable disasters. It has assumed the prerogative to dispense with the established laws of the land upon its own unconditional pleasure, taking upon itself the sole right to judge when they shall or shall not be executed, prejudging cases without a hearing, and [Illegible Text] offenders without a trial. There is a public law of the land, wisely intended for the harmony of the Union, providing for the protection of the state authorities against the insult and [Illegible Text] of the military establishment of the general governmentan institution always haughty in its [Illegible Text], and often dangerous in its purpose. A just complaint was preferred against a general officer of the Union, under this well known law, for acknowledged insult and contumely offered [Illegible Text] the Governor of the state; and, though a trial was formally demanded, it was as formally refused upon the ground that the first insult was given to the officer; and yet a much more meritorious officer for resenting an outrags, not upon himself, but upon his country, was not only tried but disgraced, at the instance of a petty Spanish Province. So far as relates to the states, the principle is now settled, that in all future cases, for the protection of his officers, the President will be the exclusive judge of the nature, degree and justification of [Illegible Text] crime, before it shall be submitted [Illegible Text] the authorised and [Illegible Text]

<page id="GA1826.1.P221" no="GA1826.1.230" />

tribunals of the country, thereby making the law a perfect nullity, and its object a still more vexatious mockery. It has asserted the principle, and confirmed it by the authority of practice, that the Federal Government is not founded in public opinion, or the just wishes and interest of either state or people, and that the views and inclinations of public functionaries, will be consulted and [Illegible Text] in preference to the people whose servants they are, and officers will be kept in power and made to rule over us, manage and direct our affairs, long after they have become perfectly odious, against our will, against our interest, against our solemn and repeated remonstrances, and, what is more intolerable, when it is well known that their outrages and oppressions come mixed with the most insupportable insult and derision.</p><p>An officer of the General Government has been stationed near the limits of Georgia, in charge of interests highly important to the state, where she was almost exclusively concerned, and, in the execution of his trust, he has been so studious and unwearied in opposition to the feelings and wishes of Georgia, that he has sought every occasion to [Illegible Text] her views, defeat her designs, degrade her character, and, this too, in direct contravention of the avowed, and it was hoped, sincere policy of his own government. The Executive of this state has respectfully and earnestly remonstrated against the continuance in office of a man so lost to the duties of his station, and so unmindful of what was due to his own government. This remonstrance has been thrice repeated by successive legislatures, of all parties and of all interests in the state, and yet it has been treated, if not with sheer contempt, at least with the most profound and unmoved indifferencethereby evincing, that the public good weighs nothing when it conflicts with the interest of the public servant, or the ambition of his irresponsible master. It has asserted in principle, which is also not without the aid of fact, that it can make and break treaties at pleasure, without regard to the interest and desire of states, notwithstanding such treaties are exclusively confined to the rights of states, not in their federative but individual characterrights intimately connected with their safety, [Illegible Text] from their sovereignty, and thoroughly identified with their territory and jurisdiction. The original territorial, and jurisdictional rights of Georgia, are deeply and obviously founded in her acknowledged independence, by Great Britain, and long acquiesced in by the other states upon the most mature and solemn deliberation. Though she has formed a compact with her sister states, yet in every stage of that much debated question, from the unsuccessful experiment of articles of confederation to the still stronger obligations of a national constitution, she has inflexibly reserved the rights of territory and jurisdiction, as received from the hands of conquered Britain, and she has never relinquished one particle of either to the Union or any other Government whatever. With the exception of the territory, now forming the states of Alabama and Mississippi, every instrument between them may, in vain, be searched for the least concession that will falsify this advisedly made and deliberate declaration.</p><p>By the cession just referred to, the rights of Georgia received additional confirmation, if such could have been needed, for it gave the

<page id="GA1826.1.P222" no="GA1826.1.231" />

most unanswerable proof that the general government conceived our title, both to soil and jurisdiction, perfectly unquestionable. By purchasing part of our soil, they permitted the remainder to be oursby promising to extinquish the Indian title to a permissive occupancy, they acknowledged that we had that previous right; for it must exist somewhere. Before this cession, they had no such right, consequently it was a concurrent right derived from us, obviously obtained by our [Illegible Text]; and our consent as obviously implies an original right, the exercise of which conclusively settles the question of jurisdiction. Apart from this view of the subject, if we have ever divested ourselves of this right we claim an inspection of the instrument by which it was effected. Under this contract then, for we affirm it can be found no where else, it is most wrongfully assumed, by the Executive Department of the general government, that the Indians and their lands, within the chartered and conventional limits of Georgia, passed into the exclusive care and superintendance of the national government, and that we dare not further interfere with either, unless we are prepared to break down the legion of federal power, or have strength enough to overcome its military arm. By virtue of these articles of cession, and, as it now seems in pretended compliance with their obligations, a treaty was held at the Indian Springs in 1825. It was constitutionally ratified, formally promulgated, and as deliberately notified to Georgia. The state, believing that under all its rights, both original as well as those recently acquired for her use, by the general government, there could be no difficulty in proceeding to a disposition of the territory, with a view to its final [Illegible Text] and improvementan object, though long, and to her political standing and interests, [Illegible Text] delayed, yet not the less urgent and desirablepassed a law, in the succeeding June, for its distribution among her waiting and patient citizens. Every thing was done, that she could rightfully do, and we regret to say, was permitted to be done, by the superior, not to say capricious, power of the general government, to realise the full enjoyment of this property, the right to which, seemed clearly to have lost its expectant, and had assumed and absolute vested character. Yet, in the face of all right, both [Illegible Text] and vested, was another treaty held and concluded, at Washington, with an entirely different party, though belonging to the same nation, and all the rights acquired by the first became [Illegible Text] and annulled, and Georgia was required to withhold her possession of any other land than that which was specially permitted by the last. It is now fully ascertained, that all the land of the first treaty is not contained in the second, and it seems to be as fully resolved that what the second embraces, is all that the State shall, upon her peril, receive.</p><p>Your committee cannot but view this as a most appalling state of things. It believes, and so it is persuaded, every ingenuous mind will believe, that right is with, but power is against us; and that the former, as all history will mournfully attest, can never successfully contend against the latter. It is a matter of anxious and fearful contemplation what must be result of this [Illegible Text], if we fail to enlist the well known justice and prudence of that part of the general government to which we have now been compelled so reluctantly to appeal.</p>

<page id="GA1826.1.P223" no="GA1826.1.232" />

<p>In order to place this question in a point entirely within the reach of every capacity, we would make but one remark. Could the General Government have annulled the Treaty of the Indian Springs, by a treaty, in which we were to acquire no lands at all, and by which we were to be placed, as formerly, at their perfect pleasure and convenience for another acquisition? We presume no one will answer in the affirmativeIndeed the General Government did not so conceive; for it gave the Indians decidedly to understand that the first treaty would not be revoked without a large cession of lands to Georgia; and we have no doubt that the Senate of the United States, acting under an honest and just sense of our rights, confidently behaved that the second treaty conferred upon us all the territory claimed from the Creek nation of Indians. Now if this proportion be undeniable, can any treaty be either just or constitutional that leaves out one single acre of the former purchase? For it is impossible to conceive of the justness of a role, in the application of which it would be good or bad, as to the whole, and not as to a part.</p><p>As another most astonishing result, arising from this power, claimed for the General Government, of managing and controlling the Indians and the lands occupied by them, within the chartered limits of old States, it is absolutely denied to the State of Georgia to enter the Cherokee Nation either to ascertain the boundary between herself and her sister State, or to take any measures connected with the internal improvement of the State; and this, too, within her well known and acknowledged limits. Indeed this doctrine is so very strange, not to say alarming, that it requires no small degree of faith to give credit to an assumption so wild and extravagant; and there fore your committeee, for the information of its own citizens, as well as to enlighten our fellow citizens abroad on the subject of our wrongs, supposed by many to be fancied, would beg leave to [Illegible Text] the evidence of the fact in this report. The Governor a letter to the Secretary of War states, that our Chief Engineer engaged in a reconnoisance under orders, and within the unsettled limits of Georgia, has been stopped by the Cherokees, and his further progress threatened to be arrested by forceand further, these infatuated and misguided people threaten to resist by force the execution of the measures concerted by the Governments of Georgia and Alabama for ascertaining the dividing line between the two States. [Illegible Text] answer to this letter the Secretary of War states, distinctly, that it is the opinion of the President that these measures cannot be effected without the CONSENT of the ludians, and concludes, the President is persuaded that this consent may be obtained by amicable and pacific means. If, however, it cannot, be deems a resort to coercive measures as altogether unwarrantable. If, in the justness of this view, the constituted authorities of Georgia should coincide, it will be [Illegible Text] to the President. But to guard against the consequences of different views, on their part, he feels himself required to <i>protest,</i> in the name of the UNITED STATES, against the use of forcible and hostile means to effect the purposes referred to in your letter.</p><p>These are same of the chief powers assumed by the General Government [Illegible Text] the [Illegible Text] of Georgia; but there are very many [Illegible Text]

<page id="GA1826.1.P224" no="GA1826.1.233" />

of peculiar aggravation attending their exercise, which have given keen and deep-felt mortification to the feelings of Georgia. A sa sovereign State, in connection with others, as we fondly hope, upon [Illegible Text] of the most sincere regard and affection, all looking with no common solicitude to the maintenance of their own rights and dignity, we cannot but believe we shall kindle a sympathy strong enough, at least, to put down the force of prejudice too successfully arraved against us, though we may ultimately fail in challenging a just and returning respect for our much abused and neglected privileges.We have been iosulted by petty agentswe have been brow beaten and derided by Indians. Our Chief Magistrate at home, and our Representatives in Congress, while in the public service and under the very eye of the General Government, have been compelled to brook the insolence of half breedswe have been prevented, nay ordered to desist, from surveying our own lands, when no possible harm could ensue, and when too the General Government, under precisely [Illegible Text] circumstances, was carrying on its own surveys, among Indians unremoved from recently acquired landsa privilege heretofore uninterruptedly enjoyed by every new and fronter State, and questioned only for the first time in the case of Georgia, one of the original <i>`thirteen States'</i>We have had our Indian Allies, those who long defended Georgia from the tomahawk of the very Indians who are now so high in favor, murdered in cold blood, their families exiled from home, made wanderers and outcasts from the very country which but nine years ago was declared to be exclusively theirs, under the plighted faith and solemn written guarantee of the General Government, and all these misfortunes, cruclties and hardships they have been destined to endure, from no other cause, as we verily believe, than that of being the unswerving friends of Georgia. These are reflections that cannot fail to inspire the most touching [Illegible Text]; there is a point and anguish in their effect, which perhaps it were better to suppress than to vent; and though in silencing their upbraidings, a severe reproach is spared to the national character, yet it will be well understood by every candid mind, as it must be certainly felt by every honest bosom.</p><p>We cannot but trust that the authority to which we have now referred these unhappy differences, will duly appreciate the motive as well as the object of this appeal. Our reliance is upon the wisdom and justice of the nation. We want nothing more than we would be willing to grant; and if we know our own hearts, there is not a grievance we have [Illegible Text], which if [Illegible Text] to [Illegible Text] of our sister States, we would not promptly resent and redress, and, [Illegible Text] every [Illegible Text], feel it a bounden duty to make common cause with the injured party. We want nothing that [Illegible Text] not fairly belong to the State sovereignties. To whatever our sister States will [Illegible Text], in that we must acquiesce; if they would be contented [Illegible Text] the treatment Georgia has received, and will come out with a public declaration of the fact, from that moment our complaints are hushed We threaten no consequencesit would be idle and vain to do so The lose of confidence and affection, by reason of neglect and disappointment, is consequence enough to a reflecting [Illegible Text]; and a high minded and generous people, cannot turn from such a result, without emotions of the deepest regret.</p>

<p>Under this view of the subject, your committee beg leave to offer the following resolutions:</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That Georgia owns exclusively the soil and jurisdiction of all the territory within her present chartered and conventional limits, and, with the exception of the right to regulate commerce among the Indian tribes, claims the right to exercise, over any people white or red within those limits, the authority of her laws, as she in her wisdom may think proper; and that she has never relinquished said right either territorial or jarisdictional to the General Government, in any manner or by any instrument whatever, and the exercise of such right by said last mentioned Government, is illegal, [Illegible Text] and unjust.</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That threatening a State with an armed force, and actually attempting to carry said threats into execution by stationing the [Illegible Text] on its borders, whether the conduct of the State thus sought to be [Illegible Text], be right or wrong, is contrary to the spirit and genius of [Illegible Text] Government, a fundamental principle of which is, that the [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] to the civil authority: the former being the instrument of [Illegible Text] necessity makes a resort to the latter always indispensable in the first instance; any other course is destructive of free government, subversive of State rights, and tending to the complete [Illegible Text] of State sovereignty.</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That the refusal to arrest and punish a military officer of the General Government, who had grossly violated a law of the land, in abusing and insulting the highest authorities of a State, is, as we conceive, an abuse of office, and if not properly [Illegible Text] for, wall and ought to leave this lasting reproach upon the nation, that even [Illegible Text] republics, the law affords no protection against the views of power or the resentments of ambition.</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That the retention of a civil officer in power, after earnest and repeated solicitations for his removal, from a sovereign State, through its highest authorities, in which there was uncommon [Illegible Text], and after too it was known to his government that he was not only oppased to its own views, but was extremely inimical to the interests of the State, in which he was placed, and highly insulting to her public functionaries, is an instance of contempt for the opinion of a State, and a disregard for the welfare of a large portion of the community, highly dangerous to the principles of representative government where the public servart acts for the people and not for himself, and where, as soon as he becomes obnoxious to their interes's, [Illegible Text] to be removed.</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That the attempted abrogation of the treaty of the Indian Springs, by the treaty of Washington, in so far as it divested the State of Georgia of any right acquired under the former, is illegal and [Illegible Text], and we feel the utmost confidence, that when the General Government comes to be informed that Georgia is deprived of lands to which she had an unquestionable claim by virtue of the first treaty, it will think with us in this regard; and, actuated,

by its accustomed sense of justice, will take speedy steps to remove all obstructions to the full enjoyment of this, at present, contested right.</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That the assertion of the President that we have no right to enter the Indian country within our own limits, for the purpose of ascertaining boundary and effecting measures connected with the peaceable objects of internal improvement, without the consent of the Indians, is a doctrine which this State will not admit, and against which it does most solemnly protestIn this she has every confidence of the support of her sister States, especially those who have so long and so uninterruptedly enjoyed a similar right. And his solemn <i>protest</i> against any measures contemplated by the State to exert her right over this necessary and essential part of her sovereignty, is an instance of dictation and federal supremacy unwarranted by any grant of power to the General Government, and which we trust and believe the national legislature will promptly disavow.</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That a separate copy of this report, with the documents necessary to support the facts therein detailed be forwarded by his excellency the Governor to our Senators and Representatives in Congress, to be by them respectfully presented to each branch of Congress, with a request that they use their best exertions to have redressed the grievances of this State, in the various particulars to which this report has reference, and for the future harmony of the States, to request of that body to make an explicit declaration of the rights that belong to the National Government and those which belong to the State of Georgia, (and consequently the other States,) [Illegible Text] from the immediate differences of opinion specially enumerated in the foregoing report.</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That his excellency the Governor be requested to forward also a copy of this report and the documents, to the Governor of each State in the Union, with an earnest and respectful request, that he lay the same before the legislature of his State; and they are hereby most affectionately and respectfully solicited to express to this State, whether they are prepared to admit the foregoing principles and the powers growing out of them as belonging to the General Government, and whether Georgia is bound and must submit to the treatment which she conceives she has most wrongfully sustained at the hands of the Executive Department of the General Government;</p><approvaldate>Approved, 22d December, 1826.</approvaldate></law>

And in their expulsion they have suffered the most trying hardships, such as it would be now unavailing to describe, but which seems to demand some reparation at the hands of the white people, their former friends, to whom they have rendered some of the most useful and hazardous services.

In the second article of what is termed the new treaty, and repeated in the supplemental article to the same, the middle of the Chattahoochie river is distinctly made the line between Georgia and the [Illegible Text] Indians, and by the 13th article of said treaty the U States agree to guarantee to the Creeks all the country not herein [Illegible Text] so that if by this guarantee, the general government mean to [Illegible Text] to the Indians the absolute right to these lands and one half of said river, during the pleasure of the parties (and the term can mean nothing else) your committe, with great deference conceive, that such an indefinite assurance does amount to an alteration of boundary, and if the Indians should never choose to cede any more lands to Georgia, a doctrine they have been allowed not only to indulge but [Illegible Text] the above conclusion will, as they think, be readily perceived by any capacity.</p><p>Your committee, in placing its construction upon the other part of the Secretary's letter, think they perceive a determination on the part of the General Government to adhere to the new treaty, giving a promise, however, that as soon as our difficulties are settled with Alabama, an opportunity will be embraced to carry into effect, by fresh negotiation, if practicable, the entire [Illegible Text] of the Creek landsAnd, but for this difficulty with Alabama in fixing the dividing line, it was the design of the President, the [Illegible Text] the line had been established, to open [Illegible Text] negotiations with the Creeks, for the purpose of procuring any fragment of land such line might have left of theirs within the limits of Georgia. Now, it must be obvious to every one, that the future acquisition of this fragment, is made to depend upon a certain [Illegible Text] and that contingency is of the General Government's own creation. It supposes that there is such a [Illegible Text] anding between Georgia and Alabama, as to present an insuperable [Illegible Text] to any [Illegible Text] purchase of territory by fresh negotiation. This is not the fact, for admitting that there was doubt, as between the two States, where the line shoud run, it cannot be a [Illegible Text] of any concern [Illegible Text] the IndiansThey can have no [Illegible Text] now, whatever may have been their fears before, as to the direction

of the line and the quantity of land they might lose. The Secretary of War thinks it highly probable that he should have [Illegible Text] in obtaining their relinquishment, the more especially as were by the line run by the Georgia Commissioners, there is less than 200,000 acres of Indian lands. Let the General Government then go up to the line run by the Georgia Commissioners, and leave the dispute between the two States, to be adjusted as they think proper. If the lands could have been obtained at the time this new treaty was made, provided the dividing line had been run, there can be no good reason why they should not now be obtained, since it is run; and as to any feeling which the Indians may have in the controversy between Georgia and Alabama, they cannot be so much affected by its issue, as to make it a matter of any consequence to their interest how it terminates. Your committee must therefore believe, that the supposed difference between Georgia and Alabama, presents no [Illegible Text] to an immediate extinguishment of the Indian title to the lands left out by what is called the new treaty, and if persisted in so as to delay the acquisition of the disputed territory, it must be clear to every understanding, that our embarrassments are far from being near their termination, [Illegible Text] if, as is intimated, the new treaty is to be considered valid. The Secretary of War does not admit, that it was the intention of the last treaty to include all the territory in Georgia; he only thinks it highly probable' if the line had been run between the two States, he might have obtained itAnd speaking of the President's design to have opened fresh negotiations for the purpose of procuring the fragment, left out, and that he will hereafter, in a certain event, attempt to effect an entire cession, are, to your committee, very plain indications that the new treaty is to be regarded as the one by which Georgia must abideIf so, the State owes it to herself, to enter her solemn <i>protest</i> against such a procedure, and relying upon the validity of the old treaty, go on to occupy the lands acquired thereby, until prevented by a force either moral or physical, to which, by the laws and constitution of the Government, it will be her duty to submit: And this, as she trusts, will be shortly ascertained by the appeal she has lately been [Illegible Text] to make.</p><approvaldate>Approved, 22d December, 1826.</approvaldate></law></part></body>
