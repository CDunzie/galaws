<law id="R1838V1N240" initial.page="281"><p>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.</p><p>The Select Committee, to whom was referred so much of the Governor's Annual Message, as relates to the connection of the Western and Atlantic Rail Road, with Hiwassee Rail Road, submit the following Report:</p><p>That the Hiwassee Rail Road is an enterprize located in the State of Tennessee, commencing at Knoxville in that State, and extending to Red Clay Council Ground, on the Georgia line. The length of Road is ninety eight miles, all of which is now under contract, and in a state of construction. Twenty miles have already been graded, and about four hundred laborers are now engaged in active and constant employment upon the work. The Road has been graded for a double track, but laid only with a single one for the present. The capital of this company amounts to thirteen hundred thousand dollars, with the privilege of an increase of two hundred thousand dollars more; one half of the original amount has been subscribed for, by responsible individuals, and the other half by the State, authorizing the enterprize. The character of the stockholders, and the zeal and energy which the work is prosecuted, give an earnest that it will not be abandoned, but prosecuted to a successful completion.</p><p>The design of this Road in its undertaking, was to afford to East Tennessee, an outlet to the Atlantic Ocean, for its productions through the works of Internal Improvement, which Georgia had undertaken, in the North-West of her Territory. South Carolina satisfied of the importance of the trade of this section of Tennessee, has long since conceived the idea of obtaining it, through the great Charleston and Cincinnatti Rail Road, the scheme of which the intelligence of her citizens had projected. But many of the citizens of Tennessee, regarding that enterprize as perhaps speculative, and many men esteeming the route through Georgia, more advantageous to them, determined so soon as our own State had rendered certain the construction of the Western and Atlantic Rail Road, to commence that of the Hiwassee Rail Road. That work has been undertaken, and thus far, has progressed with energy and zeal. How far this attempt on the part of Tennessee to connect her works of Internal Improvement, with those of the State of Georgia and thus in our own ports, to find an Atlantic market, in preference to a connection with the works of South Carolina, deserves a corresponding effort on our part, to perfect the connection, is a question to be settled alone by the interest we have at stake.</p><p>That portion of Tennessee, known as East Tennessee, embraces twenty five counties, covering an area of 16,000 square miles, and containing at this time, near 250,000 inhabitants, with a soil capable of sustaining as dense a population as any

<page id="GA1838.1.P281" no="GA1838.1.282" />

section of the Union, of like size. It is not only well adapted to the culture of grain and raising of stock, but abounds in inexhaustible beds of iron ore, stone coal and other valuable minerals. No country of equal extent perhaps presents a surface more equally and advantageously intersected by water courses, which now are, or by appropriations made by the Legislature of that State, will be rendered navigable; nine of the upper or Eastern counties of this State, not only furnishing large quantities of iron ore, but being extensive grain growing, and stock raising counties, border on rivers which unite a short distance East of Knoxville, the commencement of the Hiwassee Rail Road. Six other counties lying on Clinch and Tennessee Rivers, can transport their produce to the point where the Road crosses the Tennessee and Hiwassee Rivers, while five other counties, and perhaps the most productive of any in East Tennessee, lie either immediately along the line of the Road, or convenient thereto. Thus from the location of the Hiwassee Rail Road, and the position of the several rivers, twenty counties of East Tennessee can conveniently reach some point of that Road by water, and from which, all the imports of those counties, can be transported by the same medium of conveyance to their respective destinations.</p><p>What are the amounts of imports and exports of East Tennessee, the Committee have no means of ascertaining correctly, but from the limited information afforded them, they are satisfied they are very great. The trade confined to Knoxville alone, in merchandize during the last year (a year of great mercantile depression,) equalled two millions of dollars. Reflecting for a moment upon the advantages of the trade of this large and fertile region, to our own State, the profits resulting to one State Road, from the travel and transportation which the Hiwassee enterprize will bring to it, the expediency and propriety of a connection between the two, becomes a question too clear to admit of doubt. The nearest point of approach between them, or the route and terminus of the two, have been surveyed, is said to be but fifteen miles, over a valley every way favorable to the location and construction of a Road.</p><p>Without this connection, should South Carolina prosecute her enterprize no further than Knoxville, Georgia must undoubtedly be cut off from all the trade of East Tennessee, lying to the East of that city. And should that enterprize be carried to the Ohio, we need hope for no share of the trade from Kentucky and Ohio. It would seem then, that much depends upon the connection proposed, whether Georgia shall receive that trade from the West, which her natural position and enterprize justly entitle her.</p><p>From every fact thus presented, it seems manifest to your Committee, that the vast interests involved, will sooner or later and at no distant day, perfect that much desired connection.

<page id="GA1838.1.P282" no="GA1838.1.283" />

And the Committee most heartily respond to the sentiment advanced by his Excellency, that this connection should be made.</p><p>The Legislature of 1836, not then having the authority to enter upon the territory of Tennessee, ordered a survey of the Western and Atlantic road, as far as the State line. From the report of the Engineer in chief, to the last Legislature of his acts under that authority, it appears that upon reaching the neighborhood of the State line, a point beyond the termination of the present contracts was assumed, from which three routes were surveyed to that boundary. One of them reached it at Red Clay, the terminus of the Hiwassee road, and the other two, at points to the west of that. The first was shorter than the middle route, by four miles and of less cost by one hundred and twenty-two thousand dollars, and shorter than the western route by twelve miles, and of less cost by one hundred and seventy-three thousand dollars.</p><p>The Legislature having regarded the commencement of this great enterprise of primary importance, and having no certainty of the construction of the Hiwassee Railroad, has never thought proper hitherto, to direct its attention to the connection of its own work, with that of any other State, and hence has never required any surveys, which looked to the practicability of such a scheme. The absolute certainty of the completion of the Hiwassee Railroad and the advantages and benefits which must result to us from its connection with the State road, suggest to the committee the propriety of such surveys beyond the point at which the contracts now let, terminate, to the Tennessee river by Red Clay, and by such other points as may be deemed advisable, having reference to the termination of the State road, on that river and its connection with the Hiwassee road. The committee are now fully strengthened in the correctness of his opinion from the fact, that there is no material difference in the length from the point assumed to the Tennessee river as now surveyed, and that leading by Red Clay. The committee therefore present the following Resolutions.</p><p><i>Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of Georgia, in General Assembly met</i>, That the connection of the Western and Atlantic Railroad, with the Hiwassee Railroad, is an enterprise very much to be desired by the State of Georgia, and that in due time she will perfect the same.</p><p><i>Resolved</i>, That with a view to faciliate said connection, the Chief Engineer be instructed to cause the necessary surveys to be made, in order to show the practicability of the same at a point nearer to the southern terminus of said Hiwassee Railroad, than that indicated in his late report, and that he cause a route to be surveyed by Red Clay to the Tennessee river, from some proper point on the Western and Atlantic Railroad, and upon finding such connection practicable in either way without too gaeat a sacrifice [Illegible Text] or cost of construction,

he is further authorized, and instructed, to make such a location of the Western and Atlantic Railroad, as will be best calculated to subserve the purposes herein contemplated: <i>Provided</i>, such change of route shall not conflict with the interest of the main work.</p><p>In House of Representatives, agreed to, 26th Dec. 1838.</p><p>JOSEPH DAY,</p><p>Speaker of the House of Representatives.</p><p>AttestJohn H.

It has been ascertained that the proportion of insane persons is about one in one thousand of the entire population. This important fact, as stated by the Commissioners, calls loudly upon the Legislature to have constituted, within this State, a Lunatic Asylum for those who have been deprived, of their reason. It is believed by medical men, and stated by the Commissioners, that a suitable treatment of insane persons in an Asylum, has frequently tended to restore the unfortunate victims of insanity to their reason. During the last session of the General Assembly, the benevolent plan was commenced to provide, within our own State, an Asylum for the Insane, and the sum of twenty thousand dollars appropriated. Of this sum, four thousand dollars were expended in the purchase of a suitable site for the necessary buildings, by the Committeethe balance is deemed too small to complete the buildings necessary for the object the Legislature had in view. The reasons why no further progress has been made in the work, as stated in the Report of the Commissioners, which your Committee ask leave to make a part of this Report.</p><p>Your Committee would recommend a vigorous prosecution of the enterprize by the Commissioners. To that end, they present the following resolutions:</p>
