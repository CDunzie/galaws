The engineer and viewers shall have power to employ such assistants as may be necessary to make a complete survey of the drainage district, and shall enter upon the ground and make a survey of the main drain and all its laterals. The line of each ditch, drain or levee shall be plainly and substantially marked on the ground. The

<page id="GA1911.1.P112" no="GA1911.1.115" />

course and distance of each ditch shall be carefully noted and sufficient notes made, so that it may be accurately plotted and mapped. A line of levees shall be run for the entire work and sufficient data secured from which accurate profiles and plans may be made. Frequent bench marks shall be established along the line, on permanent objects, and their elevation recorded in the field books. If it is deemed expedient by the engineer and viewers other levees may be run to determine the fall from one part of the district to another. If an old water course, ditch or channel is being widened,. deepened, or straightened it shall be accurately cross sectioned so as to complete the amount of cubic yards saved by the use of such old channel. A drainage map of the district shall then be completed, showing the location of the ditch or ditches and other improvements and the boundary as closely as may be determined by the records of the lands owned by each individual land owner within the district. The location of any railroad or public highways and the boundary of any incorporated towns or villages within the district shall be shown on the map. There shall also be prepared to accompany this map a profile of each levee, drain or water course showing the surface of the ground, the bottom or grade of the proposed improvement and the number of cubic yards of excavation or fill in each mile or fraction thereof, and the total yards in the proposed improvement and the estimated cost thereof, and plans and specifications, and the cost of any other work required to be done. <sidenote>Surveys, how made.</sidenote></p><p>Sec. 11.

It shall be the duty of the engineer and viewers to personally examine the land in the district and classify it with reference to the benefit it will receive from the construction of the levee, ditch or water course or other improvement. In case of drainage, the degree of wetness of the land, its proximity to the ditch or a natural outlet and the fertility of the soil shall be considered in determining the amount of benefit it will receive by the construction of the ditch. The land benefited shall be separated in five classes. The land receiving the highest benefit shall be marked Class A, that receiving the next highest benefit Class B, that receiving the next highest benefit Class C, that receiving the next highest benefit Class D, and that receiving the smallest benefit Class E. The holdings of any one land owner need not necessarily be all in one class, but the number of acres in each class shall be ascertained, though its boundary need not be marked on the ground or shown on the map. The total number of acres owned by one person in each class, and the total number of acres benefited shall be determined. The total number of acres of each class in the entire district shall be obtained and presented in tabulated form. The scale of assessment upon the several classes of land returned by the engineer and viewers shall be in the ratio of five, four, three, two and one; that is to say, as often as five mills per acre is assessed against the land in Class A, four mills per acre shall be assessed against the land in Class B, three mills

<page id="GA1911.1.P114" no="GA1911.1.117" />

The engineer and viewers shall keep an accurate account and report to the Court the name and number of days each person was employed on the survey, and the kind of work he was doing and any expenses that may have been incurred in going to and from the work, and the cost of any supplies or material that may have been used in making the survey. <sidenote>Cost of surveys.</sidenote></p><p>Sec. 14. In case the work is delayed by high water, sickness or any other good cause, and the report is not completed at the time fixed by the Court, the engineer and viewers shall appear before the Court and state in writing the cause of such failure, and ask for sufficient time in which to complete the work, and the Court shall set another date by which the report shall be completed and filed. <sidenote>Extension of time for reports.</sidenote></p><p>Sec. 15. When the final report is completed and filed it shall be examined by the Court, and if it is found to be in due form and in accordance with the law, it shall be accepted, and if not in due form it may be referred back to the engineer and viewers, with instructions to secure further information to be reported at a subsequent date to be fixed by the Court. When the report is fully completed and accepted by the Court a date, not less than twenty days thereafter, shall be fixed by the Court for the final hearing upon the report, and notice thereof shall be given by publication in a newspaper of general circulation i nthe county and by posting a written or printed notice on the door of

At the date set for the hearing any land owner may appear in person or by counsel, and file his objection in writing to the report of the viewers; and it shall be the duty of the Court to carefully review the report of the viewers and the objection filed thereto, and make such changes as are necessary to render substantial and equal justice to all the land owners in the district. If in the opinion of the Court the cost of construction, together with the amount of damages assessed is not greater than the benefits that will accrue to the land affected, the Court shall confirm the report of the viewers. If, however, the Court finds that the cost of construction, together with the damages assessed, is greater than the resulting benefit that will accrue to the lands affected, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings at the cost of the petitioners, and the sureties upon the bond so filed by them shall be liable for such costs. The Court may from time to time collect from petitioners such amounts as may be necessary to pay costs accruing, other than costs of the engineer, his assistants and freeholders, such amounts to be repaid from the special tax herein authorized. <sidenote>Objections to report and judgment of Court.</sidenote></p><p>Sec. 17.

After the said drainage district shall have been declared established, as aforesaid, and the survey and plan therefor approved, the Court shall appoint three persons who shall be designated as the Board of Drainage Commissioners. Such Drainage Commissioners shall first be elected by the owners of the land within the drainage or levee district, or a majority of same, in such manner as the Court shall prescribe. The Court shall appoint those receiving a majority of the votes. If any one or more of such proposed Commissioners shall not receive the vote of a majority of such land owners the Court shall appoint all, or the remainder from among those voted for in the election.
