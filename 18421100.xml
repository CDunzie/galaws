No State has a legal or moral right to interfere with the domestic policy or internal regulations of a sister State. Georgia has never rebuked Massachusetts for fraternizing with negroes, nor held her up to the reprobation of the States of this Union, for her violations of the Charter of Confederacy, by proclaiming those citizens, who were not so at the time of the adoption of the Federal Constitution; thereby attempting to add to that sacred instrument, and thus violating the letter and spirit of the compact.</p><p>If your Committee had no other lights to guide them, than those furnished by the Constitution, they would be at a loss to ascertain what clause is referred to by the Legislature of Massachusetts, as being violated by the law above alluded to; but we are constrained to suppose that this bold assertion is based upon that section which grants to the citizens of each State, all the privileges of citizens in the several States. The meaning of this article is too plain for cavil; and could only have been intended to guaranty to the citizens of any one State the privileges to which citizens of other States were entitledor in other words, admitting negroes to be

citizens under the Constitution, (which is utterly denied.) Georgia would have no right to exclude the black citizens of Massachusetts from privileges granted to the black citizens of Maine or New York. It is an universal rule of construction, that terms used in Statutes, are to be construed according to their generally received import; and this rule applies with great force to the Constitution of the United States, were negroes or persons of color, regarded as citizens at the time of the adoption of the Federal Constitution. They were not; and the term citizen, as used in that instrument, can only refer to those who were embraced in its definition at the time of its adoption. But upon this subject, Georgia will not condescend to argue; she will adopt the language of Massachusetts, in her remonstrance against the embargo, and say, that the people of this country are not accustomed to class among their rights, such enjoyments and privileges as depend on the will of any set of men, whatever; under such circumstances, they would cease to be the rights of a free people.</p><p><i>Be it, therefore, Resolved</i>, That negroes, or persons of color, are not citizens, under the Constitution of the United States; and that Georgia will never recognize such citizenship.</p><p><i>Be it further Resolved</i>, That His Excellency, the Governor, transmit a copy of the above Preamble and Resolutions to the Governors of the several States of this Confederacy.</p><p>In Senate, agreed to unanimously, December 24th, 1842.</p><p>ROBERT M.

<page id="GA1842.1.P177" no="GA1842.1.183" />

<p>That the various circumstances which preceded and attended the imposition of the fine on Andrew Jackson, in 1815, by the District Judge of Louisiana, and the causes alleged for its exaction, are known to the country, and have recently been the subject of extended examination and discussion in the Senate of the United States. The Committee deem it needless, therefore, to recapitulate to the Legislature of Georgia, the details (and the evidence to sustain them) of an incident of marked character in the history of this Republic, at one of its most interesting epochs; an incident connected with the public conduct of one of the most distinguished men of the age, at an eventful period of his life, and that is as widely and generally known as the victory which consummated his renown and saved an important portion of the Union from devastation and plunder. Such recapitulation, and the exhibition of such wisdom, would be as inappropriate and unnecessary, it seems to the Committee, as a labored effort to prove that Warren fell at Bunker Hill, and Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown.</p><p>The authenticity of these striking events in the revolutionary annals of the country, and the imposition of a fine on Andrew Jackson, for the inflexible discharge of a responsible and perilous duty, rest upon the same basis, traditionary and historical evidence, and have made an equally durable impression on the public mind. The disposition and arrangements made at New Orleans immediately preceding the Eight of January, 1815, have ever since been hailed with universal acclaim, in every part of the land, and attest the wisdom and firmness of the Commanding General, at an awful crisis. Those only who have mingled in the turbulance of war and the convulsions of revolutions; who have seen the abodes of domestic peace invaded, and danger and death hover around their habitations; who have witnessed the citizen driven in terror from his peaceful occupation, by the unsocial sound of the drum and the approaching footsteps of a hostile foe, can realize the horrors of war; or know any thing of the stern determination and the extraordinary measures demanded, to meet the crisis, and to conduct it to a fortunate issue. These difficulties and dangers, perhaps, never presented themselves in more fearful array, or threatened more appalling consequences, than at the instant when Andrew Jackson proclaimed the existence of Martial Law over New Orleans. History, impartial history, in recounting the incidents of the brilliant achievements of the Eighth of January, 1815, speaks but one voice. It paints, in vivid colours, the strength and discipline, and desperate resolution of the invading force; the doubt, dismay, and confusion, in our ranks, and the indomitable courage and extraordinary energy of the man, who, by assuming supreme authority, and enforcing implicit obedience, saved

<page id="GA1842.1.P178" no="GA1842.1.184" />

a city from pollution and plunder, and conducted the American Arms to a triumphant result. This authority demanded to check the traitor within, as well as to repel, succesfully, the enemy without, and assumed only when the ordinary discipline of the camps was insufficient, could tolerate no interference with its uninterrupted exercise. Such influence would have rendered it a mockery, and have defeated the objects of its declaration. Insensible, however, or regardless of the imperious circumstances which prompted the establishment of Martial Law, and strangers to those elevated feelings which actuated the Patriot in the hour of danger; there were those who sought to overthrow its authority, and again to expose the city to the threatened horrors of anarchy and confusion. Equal to the crisis, and avoiding no responsibility, Andrew Jackson promptly suppressed the iniquitous attempt. And the brilliant result which immediately ensued, in connection with the almost superhuman exertions required to achieve it, demonstrated the necessity of the assumption of absolute power by the Commanding General, and its direct agency in maintaining the lustre of American Arms, and in perpetuating National Freedom and Independence. Peace restored and danger removed, it was natural to suppose that the disorganizing spirits, conscious of guilt, would have suppressed their impotent malice, and have sought to conceal the obliquity of their conduct. Fired with rage, and inflated with official consequences, vengeance was sought; and at a moment when every heart glowed with gratitude to him who had encountered the hardships of War, and had assisted in preserving the freedom of his countrywhen he was receiving the just tribute of respect from every class, for the bravery he had displayed, and the extraordinary services he had rendered, Andrew Jackson was arraigned and fined; and a reversal of that sentence is now asked, for the man who has grown gray in honorable servicewho has obtained laurels in the field and honor in the Cabinet; and who should find his reward in the gratitude and attachment of his country.</p><p>The Committee, therefore, recommend the adoption of the following resolution:</p><p><i>Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of Georgia, in General Assembly met</i>, That our Senators in Congress be instructed, and our Representatives be requested, to urge the passage of a law, refunding to Andrew Jackson, of Tennessee, with interest and cost, the fine of one thousand dollars, imposed on him by the Judge of the Louisiana District, in 1815, for the alleged offence against the authority of said Judge.</p><p><i>Resolved</i>, That the Governor of this State be required to

If the Constitution of the United States has closed the doors of the Courts of Justice against creditors of the several States, the obligation to meet all our engagements, becomes the stronger and more binding. We have placed this barrier beyond which the creditor cannot pass; and to avail ourselves of it, to defeat the claims of others, is alike unjust and dishonest. Nor is the case at all changed, or the obligation lessened, if the borrowed money has been misapplied, and the State defrauded and deceived by its own agents. The State was in fault in appointing unfit or dishonest agents, and it should bear the consequences.</p><p>It is a beautiful feature in our Government, and strongly illustrative of that high-toned moral feeling which characterized the Fathers of the Revolution, that so far from repudiating their debts, they incorporated the obligation to pay into the very charter of our national existence.

Berrien, beg leave to offer the following report and resolutions:</p><p>The Committee have read with care and attention, the Address of the Honorable John M. Berrien, and feel that they would be unworthy of the trust delegated to them did they not give it that notice which its principles and doctrines seriously demand.</p><p>The Address is in reply to the preamble and resolutions passed by the last Legislature, on the subject of many important measures of national concern; and whilst we admit the perfect right of the Senator to address the people, the source of all power, yet we deem, that it would have been nothing more than common courtesy, for him also, to have addressed his immediate constituents, the body from whom he derived his office, and upon whose action and opinions, he was commenting.</p><p>The Address was promulgated just previous to the general elections, and was evidently intended to operate on their results. But the people were not convinced, and the signal rebuke which they gave to the Senator, by the election of

<page id="GA1842.1.P190" no="GA1842.1.196" />

Representatives in Congress, and a majority of both branches of the General Arsembly, professing opinions diametrically to those advanced by him, should have carried conviction to his mind, that he was no longer a fit and proper representative of the State of Georgia. He appealed to the peopleand should he not be governed by their verdict? A man who loves his country, and its institutions, better than his own aggrandizement, would never hold office a moment after he had lost the confidence of the people. The Committee are free to acknowledge, that this Legislature has <i>no power to compel a Senator to resign</i>; but the theory of a representative government, and the delicate connexion between the constituent and the representative, imperiously demand that whenever he ceases to subserve the object of his appointment, he should at once surrender the delegated trust. Tested by this plain and obvious rule, Mr. Berrien will utterly defeat the end and aim of representative government, should he continue to retain the office of Senator in Congress. The Committee however, would not advise you to derogate from your official dignity, so far as to prefer <i>any request to an agent</i>, who disavows your authority. The man who disregards the <i>twice</i> expressed will of the <i>people of Georgia</i>, will in all probability, pay as little attention to the wishes of <i>their</i> legislature. We feel it however due to the <i>majesty of the State of Georgia</i>, that <i>we</i> her <i>servants</i>, should withdraw ourselves from all official contact with the Honorable John McPherson Berrien, and leave him in the <i>isolation</i> he has chosen for himself, to hold (if it so please him) the office to which he has been electedto enjoy (if that can comfort him,) the wages of his office.</p><p><blockquote><p>Cassio I loved thee, But never more be officer of mine.</p></blockquote></p><p>The people of Georgia are opposed to a National Bank; to the distribution of the proceeds of the sales of the public lands; to the abolition or modification of the veto power; and with Judge Berrien, in the palmy days of his intellect, they <i>utterly deny the constitutional power of Congress</i> to enact a tariff of protection, and regard such a tariff as <i>unequal in its operation, oppressive and unjust</i>. And yet, upon each, and all of these important questions, the people of Georgia differ materially from Mr. Berrien.</p><p><i>Be it therefore resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of Georgia</i>, That the opinions of the honorable John M. Berrien, on the subject of a National Bank; the adjustment of the Tariff; the distribution of the proceeds of the sales of the public lands, are in direct opposition to the principles of a large majority of the people of this State.</p><p><i>Be it further resolved</i>, That the veto power is the great conservative principle of the Constitution, and its abolition or
