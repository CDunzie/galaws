Murder, is the killing of a human being with malice, express or implied.</p>

<page id="GA1816.1.P144" no="GA1816.1.147" />

<p> 2. Express malice, is that deliberate intention to take away the life of a fellow creature, which is manifested by external circumstances capable of proof.</p><p> 3. Malice shall be implied where no considerable provocation appears, and where all the circumstances of the killing shew an abandoned and milignant heart.The punishment of murder shall be death.</p><p> 4. Murder shall be denominated homicide in the first degree.</p><p> 5. Manslaughter, is homicide in the second degree. Manslaughter is the killing of a human creature without malice, express or implied, and without any mixture of deliberation whatever. It must be voluntary, upon a sudden heat of passion; or involuntary, in the commission of an unlawful act, or a lawful act, without due caution and circumspection.</p><p> 6. In all cases of voluntary manslaughter, there must be some actual assault upon the person killing, or an attempt by the person killed, to commit a serious personal injury on the person killing. Provocation by words, threats, menaces or contemptuous gestures, shall be in no case sufficient to free the person killing, from the guilt and crime of murder. The killing must be the result of that sudden violent impulse of passion, supposed to be irresistable; for if there should appear to have been an interval between the assault or provocation given, and the homocide, sufficient for the voice of reason and humanity to be heard, the killing shall be attributed to deliberate revenge, and punished as murder.</p><p> 7. Voluntary manslaughter shall be punished by confinement, or labor, or solitude, in the Penitentiary, for a term not less than one year, nor longer than five years.</p><p> 8. Involuntary manslaughter, shall consist in the killing of a human being, without any intention to do so; but in the commission of an unlawful act, or a lawful act, which probably might produce such a consequence.</p><p> 9. Involuntary manslaughter, in the commission of an unlawful act, shall be punished by confinement or labor, or solitude in the penitentiary, for a term not less than six months, and not longer than three years.</p>

<page id="GA1816.1.P145" no="GA1816.1.148" />

<p> 10. Involuntary manslaughter in the commission or performance of a lawful act, where there has not been observed necessary discretion and caution, shall be punished by confinement or labor, or solitude in the penitentiary, for a term not less than three months, and not longer than one year.</p><p> 11. In all cases of voluntary or involuntary manslaughter, the jury may recommend the commutation of the punishment in the penitentiary, for that of confinement in the common jail of the county where the offence may have been committed, and a fine to be imposed at the discretion of the court, which fine shall be paid to the Clerk of the Inferior court, for the use of the poor of the county where the conviction takes place.</p><p> 12. There being no rational distinction between excusable and justifiable homicide, it shall no longer exist. Justifiable homicide, is the killing of a human being in self defence, or in defence of habitation, property or person, against one who manifestly intends or endeavors by violence or surprise, to commit a known felony, such as murder, rape, robbery, burglary, and the like, upon either.</p><p> 13. A bare fear of any of these offences, to prevent which the homicide is alleged to have been committed, however well grounded such apprehension may be, will not justify or warrant the killing; there must be an actual danger at the time, and the felony must have been intended.</p><p> 14. If a person invades or trespasses on the property or habitation of another, not with an intention to commit a felony, the killing shall be murder, manslaughter or justifiable homicide, according to the circumstances of the case.</p><p> 15. If a person kills another in his defence, it must appear that the danger was so urgent and pressing, that in order to save his own life, the killing of the other was absolutely necssary; and it must appear also, that the person killed was the assailant.</p><p> 16. In no case shall a person justify the killing of another, under the pretence of necessity, unless he were

wholly without fault, imputuable by law, in bringing that necessity upon himself.</p><p> 17. Killing a slave in the act of revolt, or when the said slave resists a legal arrest, shall be justifiable homicide.</p><p> 18. In all cases the killing or maiming a slave or person of color, shall be put upon the same footing of criminality as the killing or maiming a white man or citizen.</p><p> 19. If after persuasion, remonstrance or other gentle measures used, a forcible attack and invasion on the property or habitation of another, cannot be prevented, it shall be justifiable homicide to kill the person so forcibly attacking and invading on the property or habitation of another; but it must appear, that such killing was absolutely necessary to prevent such attack and invasion, and that a serious injury was intended or might accrue to the person, property or family of the person killing.</p><p> 20. All other instances which stand upon the same footing of reason and justice as those enumerated, shall be justifiable homicide.</p><p> 21. The homicide appearing to be justifiable, the person indicted, shall upon his trial, be fully acquitted and discharged.</p><p> 22. If any woman shall endeavor privately, either by herself or the procurement of others, to conceal the death of any issue of her body, male or female, which, if it were born alive, would by law be a bastard, so that it may not come to light, whether it was murdered or not, every such mother, being convicted thereof, shall suffer an imprisonment at hard labor or in solitude in the penitentiary, for any time not exceeding one year.</p><p> 23. If the same indictment charges any woman with the murder of her bastard child, as well as with the offence in the preceding section; the jury by whom such woman shall be tried, may either acquit or convict her of both offences; or find her guilty of one and acquit her of the other; and if any person shall counsel, advise or direct such woman to kill the child she is pregnant or goes with, and after she is delivered of such child she kills it; every such person so advising or directing, shall

be deemed accessory to such murder, and shall have the same punishment as the principal shall have.</p><p> 24. The constrained presumption, arising from the concealment of the death of any child, that the child whose death is concealed, was therefore murdered by the mother, shall not be sufficient or conclusive evidence to convict the person indicted, of the murder of her child, unless probable proof be given, that the child was born alive, nor unless the circumstances attending it shall be such as shall satisfy the minds of the jury, that the mother did wilfully, and maliciously, destroy and take away the life of such child.</p><p> 25. If any person shall be charged with voluntary or involuntary manslaughter, happening in consequence of an unlawful act, it may be lawful for the Attorney or Solicitor General, to wave the felony by leave of the court, and to proceed against, and charge such person with a misdemeanor, and such person on conviction for said misdemeanor, shall be punished by paying a fine, to be appropriated as the court may direct, or the jury recommend, not exceeding one thousand dollars; and the Attorney or Solicitor General may, without obtaining the leave of the court, charge the felony and the misdemeanor in the same indictment; and the jury by whom the said person shall be tried, may find said person guilty of either charge.</p><p> 26. Mayhem shall consist in depriving a person, free or a slave, of a member, or disfiguring or rendering it useless.</p><p> 27. If any person shall unlawfully cut out or disable the tongue, put out an eye, slit the nose, ear or lip, or cut off or disable any limb or member of another, with intention in so doing to maim or disfigure such person, or shall voluntarily, maliciously and of purpose, pull or put out an eye or eyes, while fighting or otherwise, every such person shall be guilty of mayhem.</p><p> 28.

This subject, to which your memorialists respectfully solicit the attention of your Excellency, is the stipulation in the articles of agreement and cession, entered into on the 24th of April, 1802, between the Commissioners of Georgia, and Commissioners of the United States, in which the United States have pledged themselves, to [Illegible Text] the Indian title, to all lands within the limits of Georgia.</p>

<page id="GA1816.1.P203" no="GA1816.1.207" />

<p>The Citizens of Georgia, satisfied with this stipulation of the compact, and reposing great confidence in the disposition of the General Government to fulfil every engagement of the United States, and particularly this, flattered themselves with the hope, that the treaty of General Jackson, would have obtained a further cession of territory, and established a line with a much greater respect for the interest of Georgia, than that treaty has evinced.</p><p>No crissis ever presented such prospects of an advantageous extinguishment of Indian title as the period of the Treaty referred to. A severe [Illegible Text] had been inflicted on the Creekstheir power was brokentheir arrogance subdued;  it only became necessary under these circumstances, to have demanded and obtained an accession to such terms, as the United States, looking to their compact with Georgia, might have thought proper to have dictated. These circumstances, were not permitted however to have their appropriate weight of influence, and therefore the citizens of Georgia have found themselves mortified and disappointed in all the expectations they had formed of the results of this treaty. In adverting to the boundaries of the treaty, it will be readily perceived, that the two great objects which should always have been in view, an extension of settlement and security of frontier, have been greatly, if not totally, neglected.</p><p>Your memorialists, referring to the most approved maps of the Creek nation, think these facts clearly establishedThat the course from the Chatahoochie, running due East, to a point which shall intersect the line now dividing the lands claimed by the Creek nation from those claimed by the state of Georgia, will throw the rivers Ocmulgee and Altamaha on the left, and will strike the Georgia line a short distance, or not far below the Fort formerly called Fort-James, and consequently, leave the Indian title unextinguished to the narrow, but important, slip of land, for the whole distance along  between the line and the river Ocmulgee.</p><p>Now it appears to your memorialists, and after proper consideration your Excellency must be convineed, that

Georgia has derived little or no advantage from the establishment of this line; for leaving out of view the sterile and unprofitable territory acquired, it can scarcely be expected, that our citizens, or emigrants from any section of the United States would occupy a territory, having on one side the Spanish line, and the Indians between them  the settlements in Georgia. Such would be their situation according to the line established in the treaty of General Jackson.</p><p>Your memorialists beg leave further to represent as a just ground of complaint, that according to the treaty concluded by Gen. Jackson, all the Territory left for the use of the Creek nation of Indians, lies either within the limits of Georgia or stretches along its western boundary. The consequence of this state of things must be obvious.</p><p>The government of the United States will now find it extremely difficult ot obtain a further extinguishment of Indian title, in the very quarter where by positive compact they were most bound to obtain it, and have by their own act rendered a compliance with their solemn engagement to Georgia, distant and precarious.</p><p>Your Memorialists believing that in this Treaty the interests of Georgia have been abandoned, or at least overlooked, and that she can now, or at any other period, rightfully claim of the United States a more satisfactory compliance with the stipulation of their compact, DO, for and in behalf of the citizens of Georgia, protest and remonstrate against said treaty, so far as it relates to extinguishment of Indian title within the limits of said state; and DO further, for and in behalf of the citizens of said state, request that measures may be taken as speedily as circumstances will permit, to procure an additional cession of territory, and extinguishment of Indian title, conformably to the stipulation contained in the said articles of agreement and cession, entered into between the commissioners of Georgia and of the United States.</p><approvaldate>Approved, 19th December, 1816.</approvaldate></law><law id="R1816V1N102" initial.page="208"><shorttitle><i>In Senate,</i> 16th December, 1816.</shorttitle><p><i>Resolved,</i> That Doctor Samuel Boykin, Doctor Tomlinson
