Then immerse the oil cup in the water and pour in oil so as to fill the cup up to within one-eight of an inch of the plunge.

Next, carefully with a dry towel or cloth, wipe the upper inner parts of the oil cup so as to remove any drops of oil that might have spattered on the upper part of the cup. Then put on the glass cover of the oil cup, pass thermometer through the hole in the cork to such a point that the mercury bulb will just be covered by the surface of the oil. Next light the lamp and introduce it under the water bath, so adjust the flame that the temperature will rise at the rate of two degrees a minute. Wait until the temperature reaches 99 degrees F., then light a wooden toothpick and pass the flame through the semi-circular opening in the glass plate at such angle as to clear the glass cover, and to a distance about half way between the oil and the cover. The motion should be steady and uniform, rapid and without pause. The appearance of a slight bluish flame shows that the flashing point has been reached.

But the city of Douglas shall have the right after said award is filed, to abandon its purpose of widening, extending, straightening, opening, laying out or establishing said street, alley, lane, way or square in the event the mayor or aldermen of said city should consider that the sum found to be due would, in their judgment, make said land so sought to be condemned too expensive to said city.
