And, <sidenote>Preamble.</sidenote></p>

<page id="GA1860.1.P234" no="GA1860.1.239" />

<p><i>Whereas,</i> This spirit of fanaticism has allied itself with a design, long entertained by leading politicians of the North, to wield the taxing power of the Government for the purpose of protecting and fostering the interests of that section of the Union, and also to appropriate the common Territories of the United States to the exclusive use of Northern emigration, for the purpose of extending, consolidating, and rendering that power irreversible, And, <sidenote>Preamble.</sidenote></p><p><i>Whereas,</i> These designs and movements have attained such ascendency, as to combine a large majority of the Northern people in this sectional party, which has elected to the Presidency and Vice-Presidency of the United States, candidates who are pledged in the most solemn form, and by the plainest, repeated declarations, to wield all the influence and power of the Federal Government to accomplish the objects and purposes of the party by which they have been elected. And, <sidenote>Preamble.</sidenote></p><p><i>Whereas,</i> Many of the slaveholding States are about to assemble in Conventions for the purpose of adopting measures for the protection of their rights and the security of their institutions. And, <sidenote>Preamble.</sidenote></p><p><i>Whereas,</i> The State of Mississippi has, in a noble spirit of fraternity, sent a Commissioner to communicate to this General Assembly her desire in this emergency in our federal relations. Therefore be it</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> 1st.

William L. Harris. <sidenote>Reception of [Illegible Text].</sidenote></p><p><i>Resolved</i> 2d. That, believing as we do that the present crisis in our national affairs demands resistance, this General Assembly, at its present session, has with great unanimity passed an Act providing for the call of a convention of the people of Georgia, to assemble on the 16th day of January, 1861, for the purpose of determining on the <i>mode, measure</i> and time of that resistance. <sidenote>Relating to a Convention to assemble in 1861.</sidenote></p><p><i>Resolved</i> 3d. That we cordially respond to the patriotic hopes of Mississippi, so earnestly expressed by her Legislature, and so ably communicated by her commissioner; and we do hereby give to our sister State the confident assurance that, in our judgment, Georgia will promptly co-operate with her in the adoption of efficient measures for the common defense, safety and honor of the South. <sidenote>Response to the State of Mississippi.</sidenote></p><p><i>Resolved</i> 4th. That, should any or all of the Southern States determine in the present emergency to withdraw from the Union and resume their sovereignty, it is the sense of this General Assembly that such seceding States should form a confederacy under a republican form of government; and to that end they should adopt the Constitution of the United States, so altered and amended as to suit the new state of affairs. <sidenote>Republican form of Government recommended.</sidenote></p><p><i>Resolved</i> 5th.
