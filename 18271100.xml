existed the rather in leaving the Federal Government too weak and defenceless, to resist the encroachments of the statesagainst this alledged error of the great majority, a few voices were heard <i>warning</i> the people of <i>that</i> error: these <i>warnings,</i> like the warnings of the prophets of old, were disregarded or forgotten, and it is only <i>now,</i> when time has made them <i>prophecies,</i> and those prophecies are in the act of fulfillment, that the wisdom and foresight of those great men who gave them utterance, have been generally acknowledged in the southern states; it was <i>only when,</i> in a recent difference between the Federal Government and the State of Georgia, the Chief Magistrate of that government, emboldened by the silent acquiescence of the states in its gradual eneroachments, had declared his <i>right,</i> and the right of Congress, to settle that difference by the sword of the Union; it was <i>only when</i> the then Chief Magistrate of this state, <i>guided</i> and <i>actuated</i> by the purest and most <i>devoted</i> f<i>eelings</i> of affection for that Union and by his <i>right</i> and <i>just</i> sense of his high responsibilities, threw himself fearlessly upon the ramparts of the constitution, there to sacrifice himself in its defence; it was <i>only when</i> the states to the East, the North and the West stood by this scene in silence, forgetful of their own deep interest in that contest, or, if a voice was raised, <i>that voice</i> was an approval of the threatened violation of <i>rights</i> common to <i>them</i> and to <i>us;</i> it was <i>only when</i> those states seemed to have forgotten that part of the compact, by which all the states became mutual guarantees of the rights reserved to each; it was <i>only then,</i> that the people of the south were aroused from their fatal lethargy; and it is <i>only now</i> that they begin <i>deeply</i> to f<i>eel,</i> that the preservation of their happiness and prosperity depends upon the preservation of that Constitution, as it came from the hands of its makersand feelingly to know, that this can <i>only</i> be effected by union among themselves; and by a <i>[Illegible Text]</i> determination, and manly resistance to any attempts to merge these free and sovereign states into one grand, unlimited, consolidated government.</p><p>It was from these views and these convictions, that your Committee have deemed it their duty to give to the subject submitted, the most grave and serious investigation; and although in the discharge of this duty, they can hope to present but little which is new, yet they hope they will have effected the object of their appointment, if they succeed

in compressing within a narrow compass, the opinions and arguments of others, which they believe to be irrefragable.</p><p>The Federal Compact was a compact made between independent sovereignties, for the general benefit and welfare of the whole, by which each, to effect that object, relinquished to a common head, portions, and like portions, of its sovereign power; reserving to itself the exclusvie enjoyment of the residue; and by which all became mutual guarantees to each, of the absolute and exclusive enjoyment of that residue....It was an association of independent and absolute sovereignties, all believing, that by the concession of certain of their powers, which could not be fully and separately exercised by each, without interfering and clashing with the exercise of the same powers by others, those powers so conceded could be exercised most beneficially and efficiently for all....Such were the powers, and the <i>only powers</i> relinquished, or intended to be relinquished by the states; and all the powers which could be exercised by each, in a way sufficiently beneficial, and without clashing or interfering with the exercise of the same powers by the others, were intended to be retained, and <i>[Illegible Text] retained</i> by the states in their separate capacities. If this was the true intent and meaning of the parties in framing and executing that compact,  your committee cannot doubt that it was, <i>then</i> it irresistibly follows, that Congress cannot by <i>implication,</i> derive from that compact, power to do <i>any act,</i> which can interfere with the just and full exercise, by the states, of powers, which each <i>can within</i> itself exercise in a way sufficiently beneficial to itself, without clashing or interfering with the full exercise of the same powers by any other state within itself: such are the powers of each state to make roads and canals, and regulate its slave population within its own limits; whenever, therefore, it shall become a question whether a particular power is vested in the General Government, such question can always be determined by reference to this test.</p><p>But it is not the intention of your Committee to enter into the discussion on the present occasion, of what are the powers granted, or what retained by the states; or whether the Federal Government possesses other powers than those expressly defined in the Constitution, for they deem such discussion, in its full extent, wholly unnecessary to a correct

decision on the inquiry submitted to them. The question is, has Congress power to appropriate money out of the common fund to aid the Colonization Society, or for objects, to attain which, that Society was established? The most strenuous advocates of the rights and powers of the Federal Government have never ventured to contend that it is other than a government of limited sovereignty: they have contented themselves with insisting <i>only,</i> that in addition to the powers expressly granted, it possesses all powers necessary for carrying into full effect those given powers; and in a few instances, apparently trifling in themselves, but of immense magnitude when taken as precedents, (finding that these sources of power have failed to sustain them,) they have sought for shelter under the flimsy covering of the words in the 8th section, 1st article, provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United Statessuch is the case now under consideration. No one can have the hardihood to contend, that there is a word in the Constitution which expressly gives to Congress the power to make the appropriation in question; or that the exercise of such power is necessary for the full and effectual exercise of any power expressly granted; nor is there in that Constitution, any other clause than the section above referred to, which, by any construction, could be strained into a grant of such power. On these words then, are the advocates of this appropriation compelled to rest the issue of their cause, and on the intent and meaning of these words, as applicable to that issue, your committee are prepared to join in <i>that</i> issue.</p><p>It will scarcely be contended, that the establishment of an African Colony, at the distance of three thousand miles, on a barbarous and pestilential shore; or that the liberation of the slave population of the south, is necessary or essential to the common defence; nor do your Committee believe, if those objects were effected, that they would be for the general welfare of the Union. The establishment of distant colonies would, by extending our relations, multiply the causes of foreign wars; and the existence of slavery in some of the states, cannot, as your Committee can perceive, influence in any manner, the internal prosperity or affairs of the other and distant states; on the other hand, they believe, that the liberation and transportation of the slave population, even if it could by any posibility

<page id="GA1827.1.P197" no="GA1827.1.198" />

be effected, would impoverish and depopulate the southern section of our country, while it would diminish the welfare of the negroes themselves.</p><p>But it is not the intention of your Committee to inquire into the expediency of the measure, for it has been well and truly said by one who has felt and thought deeply on the subject, that to rest the exercise of the power in question on its expediency, is to give up the right, and to subject ourselves, at once, to all the evils and mischiefs consequent upon its exercise..... Your Committee have based the issue on the ground of right; they deny the power of Congress to make such appropriation; and they say, that if the question of power is to be determined by construction, and by construction alone can it be claimed, then they say, that it is manifest on the face of the Constitution itself, that the convention intended to prohibit Congress from the exercise of such power. It has been ably argued by a writer in an adjoining state, and as your Committee believe conclusively, that the words general welfare above referred to are words of limitation, and not of grant of powers: that they do not give Congress a right to appropriate money at its discretion, but limit that body to such appropriations as are for the welfare of the whole Union. But your Committee deem it unnecessary to examine what are the appropriations which Congress can constitutionally make under these words, whether they be words of limitation or not, but will confine themselves to the question, whether from other provisions of the Constitution, the clause can in either case be relied on to prove, that it was the intention of the convention, by the insertion of those words, to give the power to Congress to make the appropriation in question.</p><p>If your Committee are correct in the opinion, that the convention meant to grant to the Federal Government only those powers which could be fully and efficiently exercised by a single sovereign, and which could not be fully and separately exercised by the states individually, without clashing and interfering with each other; and that all other powers were reserved to the states respectively; and if this separation and designation of powers was deemed so important, that by an amendment of that Constitution, it was declared in express terms, that the powers not delegated to the United States, should be reserved to the states respectively,

<page id="GA1827.1.P198" no="GA1827.1.199" />

or to the people: then it follows that it could never have been the intention of the framers of that instrument, to grant to the Federal Government any power to appropriate money in a manner which could interfere with, disturb, or control the states in their fullest exercise of the powers reserved to them. But your Committee believe, that such argument on general principles, will become unnecessary to the support of the position which they have taken, if they can produce a clause in the Constitution, of reservation by the states, which would be rendered absurd and worse than useless, provided the convention intended under that clause of the 8th sec. of the 1st art. to give to Congress the power contended for. Where the meaning and effect of every word was carefully weighed and reweighed, and examined before its insertion; where every word thus carefully inserted, was afterwards jealously and severely scrutinized by thirteen assemblies of the wisest and best men in their respective states, each vigilantly watching and guarding their own local interests and circumstances, it can scarcely be believed, that two clauses would be inserted and permitted to remain, one of which would operate to defeat, and finally to destroy the whole object of the other; yet such must inevitably be the result, if the construction insisted upon be correct.</p><p>At the first establishment of the Colonization Society, whatever may have been intended or avowed as its object, your Committee believe that they can say with truth, that the general impression in the southern states as to that object was, that it was limited to the removal beyond the U. States of the then free people of colour and their descendants, and none others. Under this impression, it at once received the sanction and countenance of many of the humane, the wise, and the patriotic among us. Auxiliary Societies were formed in our own state, and the numbers, the influence and the resources of the society were daily increased: it is now ascertained that this impression was false, and its officers and your Committee believe the society itself now boldly and fearlessly avow, that its object is, and ever has been, to remove the whole coloured population of the Union to another land; and to effect this object, so wild, fanatical and destructive in itself, they ask, that the general fund, to which the slave holding states have so largely contributed, should be appropriated for a

<page id="GA1827.1.P199" no="GA1827.1.200" />

purpose so especially ruinous to the prosperity, importance and political strength of the southern states.</p><p>That the people of the south, at the time of the adoption of the Constitution, considered not only the retention, but the increase of the slave population, to be all important to the welfare and interests of their states, is manifest from a reservation in that instrument itself, which, it cannot be doubted, was inserted on their express requisition. By the first clause of the ninth section of the first article, it is provided, that the migration or importation of such persons as any one of the states now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the Congress, prior to the year eighteen hundred and eight. Who were the persons here meant? AfricansAnd for what purpose were they to be imported, and into what states? They were to be imported to be held in slavery in the southern statesWho then were the parties interested in making such reservation? The people of the south, and they aloneWhat was the motive of those people in insisting upon the reservation of the right to make such importation for twenty years? Unquestionably to increase that species of populationWhy increase it? Because they believed it to be essential to the improvement, welfare, and prosperity of their section of the country; and upon the numbers of which, by another provision of the Constitution, the weight of the southern states in the general council in part depended. If such were the motive, and what other could there have been, for the insertion of that reservation, can it be believed, that those very people meant, by another clause, to give to Congress the power to appropriate money out of the common fund to which they were so largely to contribute, for the purpose of again removing that very population, the right to increase which, was so carefully reserved; that they insisted upon retaining the right to import Africans, merely again, and in part at their own expense, to re-export them to the shore from whence they had been broughtyet such would be the effect of the constructive power contended forYour committee now ask, [Illegible Text] it can be believed for a moment, that it was the intention of the convention under those general words of the 8th section of the first article, to give to Congress a power to appropriate the common fund to the removal of the slave population of the country?</p>

<p>Your committee have done with the argumentit has been presented with the sole view of satisfying the people of Georgia, that their representatives here assembled, in entering a protest against the exercise of such power, are justified in such proceeding by the Constitution itself; and not with any hope or expectation of changing the settled purpose of those, who from selfishness or fanaticism are urging Congress to the exercise of this power; or who, from morbid sensibility, or ignorance of circumstances, or indifference to the effect upon us or our coloured population; are using every means in their power to render that people discontented with their present situation; a situation far preferable, as your committee believe, in point of ease and comfort, and nearly as independent as that of the white laborers of the Northern or Eastern States, or of any nation in Europe.</p><p>Your Committee cannot avoid reprobating the cold-blooded selfishness, or unthinking zeal which actuates many of our fellow-citizens in other states, to an interference with our local concerns and domestic relations, totally unwarranted either by humanity or constitutional rightsuch interference is becoming every day more determined and more alarming; it commenced with a few unthinking zealots, who formed themselves into abolition societies; was seized upon by more cunning and designing men for political purposes; and is now supported by more than one of the states, as is evident from the amendments of the Constitution proposed by legislative bodies, and so frequently, and indeed insultingly presented for our approbationThe result of such interference, if perserved in, is awful and inevitable. The people of Georgia know and strongly feel the advantages of the Federal Unionas members of that Union, they are proud of its greatnessas children born under that Union, they love it with filial affectionas parties to that Union, they will ever defend it from foes, internal or external; but they cannot and will not, even for the preservation of that Union, permit their rights to be assailedthey will not permit their property to be rendered worthlessthey will not permit their wives and their children to be driven as wanderers into strange landsthey will not permit their country to be made waste and desolate by those who come among us under the cloak of a time serving and hypocritical benevolence.

But how is this increasing evil to be met and remedied? Nothing can be hoped from remonstrancethe judicial tribunals of the Union cannot reach itour own Legislature can by no enactment prevent itHow then is this evil to be remedied? Only by a firm and determined union of the people and the states of the south, declaring through their legislative bodies, in a voice which must be heard, that they are ready and willing to make any sacrifice, rather than submit longer to such ruinous interference; and warning their enemies that they are unwittingly preparing a mine, which once exploded, will lay our much loved country in one common ruin. Your Committee hope that such a calamity is yet far distant, and that there is still remaining in the Congress of the Union, sufficient discretion, intelligence, and patriotism to avert it altogetherwith that hope, they deem it unnecessary now to do more than to recommend the adoption of the following resolutions:</p><p><i>Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of Georgia in General Assembly met,</i> That the Congress of the United States have no constitutional power to appropriate [Illegible Text] to aid the American Colonization Society, or for objects to effect which, that Society was established; and that this Legislature, representing the feelings and will of the people, and the sovereignty of the State of Georgia, in the name and in behalf of the <i>State</i> of Georgia, denying the right, solemnly protest against the exercise or any attempt to exercise, such unconstitutional power by the Congress of the United States.</p><p><i>And be it further resolved,</i> That copies of the above Report and Resolution be forwarded to our Senators and Representatives in the Congress of the United States, and that our senators be instructed, and our representatives be requested, whenever circumstances may render the same necessary, to present the said Resolution to both Houses of Congress, as the protest of the tate of Georgia against the right of Congress, constitutionally, to appropriate monies in aid of the American Colonization Society.</p><p><i>And be it further resolved,</i> That a copy of the above report and resolutions be forwarded to the Governor of each

That the General Government is said to be truly and emphatically a government of the people, and therefore entirely [Illegible Text] of the reach of representative bodies whose sole duty it is to keep within the sphere of their own delegated trust. It would seem that if even such a pretension were admissible, it should be considered no great breach of decorum, for a sovereign state through its highest known authority to approach a government it had contributed to establish, with a subject of complaint, especially when it is perceived that much inferior bodies are patiently listened to, and listened to with effect. While manufacturing companies and self-created delegates, pretending to represent whole States, assemble for the purpose of directing the Congress what measures they must adopt, surely the Legislature of a State without much violence to any known rule of modesty, may respectfully offer a counter remonstrance to such a growing temper of dictation. But it is not in this humble manner that your committee would recommend the Legislature to prefer their just complaints to the General Government. They claim it as a right to remonstrate with that Government on all measures which they may conceive violative of the fundamental principles of its institution. They affirm that those who create a delegated government have lawfully the power to restrain it within its proper bounds, and maintain the doctrine asserted by Luther Martin, in his address to the Legislature of Maryland, at the time of the adoption of the Federal Constitution, that the proper constituents of the General Government are the States, and

<page id="GA1827.1.P203" no="GA1827.1.204" />

the States are to that Government what the people are to the States, that this is entirely within the spirit and intention of the Federal Union.</p><p>In support of this, as well as other principles which will hereafter be presented in this report, the committee will frankly own they can offer nothing new to the Legislature, for it is a subject that has been so much discussed, all must be familiar with its details, nevertheless, with the above acknowledgment, to embody some of the leading objections to the course pursued against the rights of the States, will not, it is hoped, be considered improper, The people cannot be too well enlightened on this subject.</p><p>First, thenThe Committee contend that the States, through their Legislatures, have a right to complain of, and redress if they [Illegible Text] all usurpations of the General Government. They maintain that the terms of the grant, in the Federal Constitution, did not convey sovereign power generally, bat sovereign power limited to particular cases, and with <i>restrictive means</i> for executing such powers; and further, that the powers were delegated not by the people of the United States at <i>large,</i> but by the people of the <i>respective States,</i> and that, therefore, it was a compact between the different <i>States.</i> Composed as the States were at the close of the revolution, being independent then of each other as they were previous to that event, and in the exclusive possession of self-government, it will be readily admitted there could be but two ways to form the General Government, either by compounding the American people into one common mass, giving up their State Governments and suffering the majority to govern; or, by continuing their State Governments and delegating a part of their power to the General Government for the protection of the whole. Under one or the other of these methods [Illegible Text] General Government come into existence. Now, no one will pretend to say, that it was under the first named method: the power was not delegated by the people, composing one great <i>consolidated community,</i> but by the people of <i>each State,</i> unconnected with and independent of the people of the <i>other States,</i> in their <i>corporate capacity.</i></p><p>If the history of this transaction is attended to, every one must be convinced that, from first to last, it was a procedure of the <i>States,</i> and not of the people composing <i>one great</i> political society. They were separate and distinct before the revolutionthey <i>contendcrated</i> as States for the purpose of more effectually [Illegible Text] them through that strugglethey remained independent and were so acknowledged with all their rights, territorial and [Illegible Text], at the close of it. By <i>States</i> the proposition was [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] the powers of the Confederation. The States appoint [Illegible Text] for that purpose; they assemble, make and [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text], a Constitution, expressly declaring that when [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] by [Illegible Text] out of the thirteen States, the same

<page id="GA1827.1.P204" no="GA1827.1.205" />

shall be binding, and the States are still found exercising independent and sovereign control over their ungranted powers. Now if the assent of a <i>majority</i> of <i>all</i> the <i>people</i> of the United States was necessary to ratify this instrument, was it not as easy to have so declared, as to say that nine out of thirteen States should effect that object? Would it not have been more intelligible and have better answered the purpose, if such was intended, than the mode adopted? But that this was not intended was obvious from the fact that according to the plan pointed out for the ratification of the Constitution, more than two thirds of the States might have received the instrument, and yet a majority of the whole people would have rejected it. For instance, at the first census in 1790, Massachusetts, New-York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia had 56 members out of 105 in Congress; at the second census in 1800, they had 74 out of 141, and in 1810, they had exactly one half of twenty-three States. Now every one must perceive, if these four States had alone voted against the Constitution in opposition to all the rest, the instrument would nevertheless have been adopted, and clearly adopted against a <i>majority</i> of the <i>whole people</i> of the United States.</p><p>The absurdity of this result, to-wit to have a government founded upon the <i>will</i> of a <i>minority,</i> is so extravagant as to retute altogether the idea that the Federal Government is truly and emphatically a government of the people. But it is contended that the Constitution was ratified by the States assembled in convention, and that therefore the people of each State adopted itThis is granted; and in what other way could it have been ratified?This is the only way that the <i>sovereignty</i> of the State could act. It was the sovereign consent of the State that was askedthis could not have been expressed by any one branch of the Government of the State for the sovereignty does not lie in any one branch aloneBut after the people of each State had, in their sovereign capacity, delegated a portion of their sovereign power to the General Government, and that Government received it as a TRUST, every one must perceive, that as the people of each State cannot always remain in Convention, for the purpose of taking care of their reserved, and guarding the exercise of granted powers; and as they have in their State Constitution granted the residue of the power not previously conferred upon the General Government to their own Legislature, except such as are <i>specially</i> given to the Executive and Judicial branches of the Government, in no manner partaking of a <i>representative</i> nature, it follows that the care of this TRUST as well as every other interest of the people of each State not granted to the co ordinate branches of the State Government, belongs to their Legislature. To make this idea clearly understood: All power is in the peopleThey are obliged to exercise it by representativesThey grant a portion of it to the General GovernmentThe residue is distributed

<page id="GA1827.1.P205" no="GA1827.1.206" />

among their own Legislative, Executive, and Judicial branches of GovernmentThe watching and superintending of the power granted to the General Government so as to keep it within its proper limits, must remain somewhere The people act alone-by their State authorities; this right is not with the Executive or Judicial authorities of the State; the conclusion is irresistible, that their representatives in General Assembly met, have the right to protect the States from the usurpations of the General Government, and to remonstrate against any act that shall <i>eneroach</i> upon the <i>powers</i> reserved by the people and <i>granted</i> to their <i>own Government</i>Under this firm conviction, the committee claim for the Legislature the right to protest, and earnestly remonstrate against the exercise, on the part of the General Government, of any undue powers, and especially, a power assumed by them to encourage domestic manufactures, and to effect a system of internal improvement within the States. We know that all complaints are listened to with jealousy and sometimes with contempt, and unfortunately, this State has had stronger evidence of this, than the general truth of the remark. But we likewise know, and if it were necessary, we could produce more instances of the fact than is furnished by the American Revolution, that a long course of abuse, encroachment and oppression followed up after repeated warnings and respectful expostulations, have terminated in a convulsion fatal to the affections which generally bind together either men or nations. We do most solemnly deprecate such an issue of the attachment which we bear to the General Government, and if that Government entertains a faithful recollection of all history on this subject, and is not borne away by the pride of superion power and strength, which usually closes the ear to just [Illegible Text] there is yet no danger of such a result. But if reckless of the fact, that the only true cement of the Union, is a generous and high-minded affection of its members for each other, and that no sordid motives of speculation or selfish desire to prosper upon each other's injuries or misfortunes has brought them together, it must be obvious to every understanding, that an uncompromising course of self-willed legislation upon subjects so long and so often objected to, must inevitably end in the worst of consequences.</p><p>If the subjects of Domestic Manufactures and Internal Improvement depended upon the question of expediency; we should have nothing to say, for that is a matter purely within the power of Congress; and although we should greatly deplore the adoption and continued prosecution of a policy obviously grinding down the resources of one class of the States, to build up and advance the prosperity of another of the same confederacy, yet it would be ours to submit under the terms of our compact. All argument is vain against interest supported by power. But we do most solemnly believe, that such policy is contrary to the letter and spirit of the Federal Constitution.</p>

<page id="GA1827.1.P206" no="GA1827.1.207" />

<p>All must agree, that the best method of ascertaining the intention of the framers of the Constitution, wherever the power is doubtful, is first to go to the <i>letter</i> of the power, and then to the history of its origin as contained in the journal of the Convention. This is the method we propose to pursue in relation to the two subjects just above expressed.</p><p>When we ask for the <i>letter</i> of the above powers in the Constitution, there is a diversity of opinion on the subject, and we are pointed to various passages in that instrument, by various advocates of the General Government's right, not uniformly agreeing among themselves on the different clauses conferring this right.Now this uncertainty of itself ought to create great doubt, and in all free government, doubt and forbearance in relation to the exercise of power, ought to be synonimous. But most persons refer to that particular clause of the Constitution, which gives to Congress the power to regulate Commerce with Foreign Nations, and among the States.</p><p>Before we examine this point with reference to its particular import, it will be proper to lay down some general principles which made the <i>establishment</i> of the Federal Government at all necessary. If the intelligence and moral character of the States were altogether sufficient for their own internal police, (and that it has been, stands fortified by the most ample experience) wherefore the necessity of a General Government? Every body percelves that the laws which would do for the municipal regulation and internal affairs of Massachusetts would not do for Georgia; and therefore a Government to legislate for both, in those particulars, would be absurd and ridiculous. What then was it that made these two States <i>unite</i> in what is called a <i>General</i> Government? Does any one believe it was that <i>both States</i> should legislate for the particular interest of one, and against the particular interest of the other? Or to come more to the point, that <i>both</i> should legislate for the promotion of the <i>manufactures</i> of the one, and directly against the <i>agriculture</i> of the other! No one can believe this, unless he is prepared to say that the weaker State was utterly destitute of all sense of self-preservation. The exclusive inducement and sole motive then to the UNION was, first COMMERCE, and secondly, the COMMON DEFENCE. Every one must at once perceive, who has any knowledge of the history of the times, that at the close of the Revolution, the States were left in the most ruinous condition, as to their public <i>debt</i> and <i>credit</i>that to COMMERCE, every State looked as the only efficient source to relieve them from their burthens; and as each State had exclusively the right to regulate its own trade, the utmost perplexity and confusion must have resulted from the great diversity of interest which existed among them. <i>Commerce</i> too is the fruitful source of <i>war.</i> To regulate then, a matter so essential to the welfare and peace of the States considered as neighbors, who had just come out from a most disastrous conflict, the common

<page id="GA1827.1.P207" no="GA1827.1.208" />

dangers and sufferings of which had greatly endeared them to each other, and to DEFEND this interest from internal and external aggression, was the true and only ground of the ConfederationOr, in the language of an able writer, all that was desired, was a FEDERAL HEAD to regulate Commerce, and a <i>Federal arm</i> to protect us. To secure these objects, all the powers granted in the Constitution, are entirely referable. It is a General Government, and therefore the powers are <i>general.</i> The States never intended to give up one particle of power that related to their <i>internal police;</i> all the powers of the General Government are <i>national,</i> that is to say, they are suited to the <i>whole confederation</i> as one nation; they are not to operate partially so as to effect one State and not another. All the powers granted by the General Government, with the exception of taxation, the States cannot legislate upon, so that when it is necessary to ascertain the powers which belong to each, it is alone tested by this principleIf the General Government can legislate upon it, <i>the States cannot,</i> and <i>vice versa.</i> The two Governments do not possess <i>concurrent</i> power of legislation on the same subjects. The Federal Court has declared that it is the genius and character of the whole Government, that its action is to be applied to all the <i>external and internal concerns which affect the States generally and equally; but not to those which are completely within a particular State, which do not affect other States, and with which it is not necessary to interfere for the purpose of executing some of the general powers of the Government.</i></p><p>With these general reflections, let us proceed to consider the right of the General Government to encourage Domestic Manufactures, under the right to regulate Commerce. It is readily conceded, that any law regulating Commerce for its sole <i>advantage,</i> or for the purposes of <i>revenue</i> which shall incidentally promote the interest of Manufactures, will be perfectly reconcileable with the power to regulate Commerce; but the moment it loses sight of either of those objects, then it is a departure from the spirit and true intent of the Constitution; and a breach in that regard, according to all interpretation of law, is not less illegal, than a violation of the most express provision in the instrument. If COMMERCE was one of the prime causes of the UNION; if it was the source to which <i>each</i> State looked for its prosperity, it surely was the <i>intent</i> and <i>interest</i> of the whole to have it so regulated by the General Government, as to be productive of the greatest possible advantage to the confederation. In giving up their great source of wealth to the Union, no one can believe it was for any other object than to be encouraged, fostered, and promoted by all the means which the united energies of all the States could exert. In the power to regulate Commerce, no one could possibly conceive there was contained a lurking principle to destroy it; yet every one must admit, that the direct tendency of encouraging manufactures, is to produce that effect. And in

<page id="GA1827.1.P208" no="GA1827.1.209" />

proof of this assertion, commercial men, commercial cities, from one end of the Union to the other, raise their hands and voices in the most earnest opposition to this singular method of regulating commerce by promoting manufactures.</p><p>But there is another view of this question which is worthy of peculiar notice. It is a principle which no one will deny, that what is <i>directly</i> forbidden, cannot be <i>indirectly</i> effected. Now the Federal Constitution, in granting the power to regulate commerce, was so fearful that the regulation might be made to operate partially upon the States, to the benefit of some and injury of others, that it declared no tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any State. No <i>preference</i> shall be given by any regulation of <i>commerce</i> or REVENUE to the ports of one State over those of another. If then no regulation of commerce or REVENUE could directly be made to act unequally upon the States, how happens it that a regulation concerning manufactures bottomed upon the power to regulate commerce, can lawfully have that effect. In other words, if a law compelling Georgia to pay duties to Massachusetts for the protection of her commerce would be unconstitutional, how does it happen that a precisely similar law to protect manufactures, derived from the right to regulate commerce, is not equally so.</p><p>In carefully consulting the journal of the Convention, nothing appears on the subject of manufactures, until the 18th of AugustOn that day this power was proposed to be given, to-wit: to establish public institutions, rewards and immunities for the promotion of Agriculture, Commerce and Manufactures. On the 2fith of the same month, another proposition to assist the President in conducting the public affairs, there shall be a council of State of the following offiers: among others, the Secretary of Domestic Affairs, who shall be appointed by the President, and hold his office during pleasure. It shall be his duty to attend to matters of general police, the state of agriculture, and manufactures, <i>the opening of roads and navigation, and the facilitating communications through the United States.</i> And he shall, from time to time, <i>recommend such measures and establishments as may tend to promote those objects.</i> These propositions were referred to what was called the committee of detail; and afterwards on the 31st of August, was referred, together with some other reports which this same committee had partially made, to a grand committee composed of one member from each State. On the 5th of September this committee reported, among other things, the following proposition, which is now found standing in the Constitution, to-wit: To promote the progress of SCIENCE and the USEFUL ARTS, by securing, for limited times, to authors and inventors, the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries. This clause then is all that could be produced from the unequivocal propositions to grant

<page id="GA1827.1.P209" no="GA1827.1.210" />

the power to the General Government, of encouraging [Illegible Text] facturesAnd what is it? The right to promote [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] the <i>useful arts.</i> Under the first, no one will [Illegible Text] that the power to protect manufactures will result. It must be [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] the last. And there is no doubt, under the [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] <i>useful arts,</i> as distinguished from the term <i>fine arts,</i> both [Illegible Text] <i>and manufactures</i> would properly fall.</p><p>All persons will agree that no <i>arts</i> can be more <i>useful</i> than agriculture and manufactures. Every one must at the first [Illegible Text] perceive that, if the [Illegible Text] had have stopped at the word <i>useful arts</i> the power to promote <i>manufactures</i> would have [Illegible Text] full and complete beyond all cavil. but does it stop here? Is it a general or limited power? And if a limited power, how is it limited? Let common candor answer-the question, not by protecting duties, not by imposts on foreign exports, not by [Illegible Text] and bounties, but by securing, for limited times, to authors and [Illegible Text] the exclusive right to their respective writings (in [Illegible Text]) and discoveries (in the [Illegible Text] RTS.) Now, says an able advocate of State rights, If a power to promote a [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] by a prescribed mode, does not exclude the power to promote it by a different or other mode, then there is no truth in a [Illegible Text] maxim (in law and [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] the expression of <i>one thing</i> is the exclusion of <i>another.</i> The restrictive [Illegible Text] upon the power to promote the useful arts, must have [Illegible Text] something; and is any one so [Illegible Text] as not to own that it was merely to <i>secure to ingenious men patents for their [Illegible Text]Writings</i> and [Illegible Text] would alike benefit all the State, being <i>general</i> they would have an equal and impartial operation over the <i>whole Union</i>Not so by encouraging the <i>fabricks</i> that resulted from these inventions; for [Illegible Text] States [Illegible Text] possess greater means both moral and physical to produce them. The <i>inventor</i> of the plough might be rewarded, but no [Illegible Text] will contend that it should entitle the <i>ploughman,</i> to au exclusive privilege over the <i>weaver</i>Nor would a [Illegible Text] for the <i>steam</i> [Illegible Text] authorise a peculiar indulgence to its [Illegible Text] over the hard earned <i>bread</i> of the [Illegible Text] These being all local and partial operations, would subject the States, if [Illegible Text] to the [Illegible Text] of the general government, to the most [Illegible Text] effects, and wholly subversive of that principle which we have already mentioned, that the action of the general [Illegible Text] is to be applied to all the external and internal concerns which affect the States generally and equally; but not to those, [Illegible Text] are completely within a particular State. Manufactures [Illegible Text] been proposed in the Convention, and so had the sciences, and all that could be possibly obtained for them was the provision we have just [Illegible Text] Every one must believe if more had been intended, more could have been given; for never was a subject so entirely before a deliberative body, than was that of [Illegible Text] before the Federal Conventions.</p>

<page id="GA1827.1.P210" no="GA1827.1.211" />

<p>But there is another section of the Constitution, which when taken in connection with the history of its adoption, places this question beyond all doubt, and for the exposition of which, the committee are indebted to an able southern writer on the subject of Federal Powers. It is the following: No State shall, [Illegible Text] the [Illegible Text] of [Illegible Text] lay any imposts or duties on [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] exports, except what may be absolutely necessary for executing its inspection laws; and the nett produce of all duties and imposts laid by any State, on imports or exports shall be for the use of the Treasury of the United States, and all such laws shall be subject to the revision and control of the Congress. Those who will consult the structure of this clause, in the [Illegible Text] of the Convention, will find that perhaps none other was more disputed; and that a very different object was [Illegible Text] from that of levying a [Illegible Text] duty to execute inspection laws. What was that object? It cannot be discovered from the clause itself; and perhaps none in the constitution has been so often read without a knowledge of its true [Illegible Text] and meaning. To grant the State the privilege of [Illegible Text] duties beyond what is necessary for [Illegible Text] laws, merely to go into the National Treasury, seems to be perfectly idle. What benefit is it to be to the States? Some was certainly intended, and [Illegible Text] there is at hand a key to this mystery. It was to enable the States, within themselves, if they desired it, to protect their own manufactures, by the imposition of export duties on the raw materials, or imposts upon foreign fabrics. Without this construction, every body must at once perceive that the clause is useless and [Illegible Text] and is the only feature of the Constitution without meaning or motive. But, happily for the interest of the agricultural States, we have a [Illegible Text] and complete explanation of the object and intention of this clause.</p><p>Mr. Luther Martin, a [Illegible Text] of the Convention from the State of Maryland, in giving to his State an exposition of the [Illegible Text] on this particular clause indignantly [Illegible Text]Every State is also prohibited from laying any imposts or duties on imports and exports, without the permission of the General Government. It was [Illegible Text] by us, that there <i>might be</i> cases, in which it would be proper, for the <i>purpose of encouraging manufactures,</i> to lay duties, to prohibit the exportation of raw materials; and even in addition to the duties laid by Congress, [Illegible Text] imports for the sake of revenue, to lay a duty, to discourage the importation of particular articles into a State, or to enable the <i>manufacturer here,</i> to supply us on as <i>good terms</i> as they could be obtained from a <i>foreign market.</i> But the most that could be obtained was, that this power <i>might be exercised</i> by the <i>States,</i> with, and <i>only</i> with the consent of Congress, and subject to its control; and so anxious were they to [Illegible Text] on every shilling of our money for the general government, that they insisted even

<page id="GA1827.1.P211" no="GA1827.1.212" />

the little revenue that might thus arise, should not be [Illegible Text] to the use of the respective States where it was collected, but should be paid into the Treasury of the United States, and accordingly it was so determined. Besides fully accounting for the clause in question, what are the rational inferences from the foregoing quotation. In the first place, we see that the power of Congress itself to lay duties on imports was for the sake of <i>revenue</i> alone. In the next place, aside from the fact, that the subject of manufactures had been before the convention and settled to be promoted only by <i>patent;</i> if there had been any power reserved to the General Government to encourage that object, Mr. Martin would not have asked for that right to the States, seeing that the only manner in which it could be done was forestalled by the Constitution, in confering upon Congress the exclusive right to impose duties on imports. The States being engaged in different pursuits, all subject to clashing interests, a <i>general</i> power could not be given to the [Illegible Text] Government to regulate such a local concernAccordingly it was placed as it should be, at the discretion of each State, who might protect its own manufactures, if it should choose to do so, without calling upon its sister States to bear the [Illegible Text] Adopting the ideas of a profound writer on this subject, surely a State does not wish greater advantages by the Union, than would be enjoyed by her confederates? Surely she does not desire more, at the expense of her sister States, than she would possess if she remained free and independentSurely, if sovereign and independent of the whole world she would not lay duties to encourage her own domestic manufactures, because it would oppress her commerce and agriculture; she will not wish their [Illegible Text] at the sacrifice of the very same interests of her neighbors? If there is any State that desires her manufactures to be promoted, why does she not avail herself of the express provision intended or that purpose? Is it because it will injure her other great concerns? And have other States no interests to affect? If a State has the power by the Constitution, to do exactly what she might do if [Illegible Text] and it is her interest to do so, why does she not proceed to encourage her manufactures by the appointed means? Nothe fact is, such a State wants the profit without the [Illegible Text] of such a measure; and as long as she can tax her associates to answer her purpose, her own community will never be made to bear any of the [Illegible Text] of such an unequal system. If other States are obliged to pay the cost, or even divide it with the State seeking to establish her manufacturing institutions; if their exports and imports are to contribute to the welfare of northern money-making projects, and to advance the schemes of private capitalists, depend upon it, the only method that will be pursued is the one found in the increasing exactions of the tariff [Illegible Text] of 1816, 20 and 24.</p>

<page id="GA1827.1.P212" no="GA1827.1.213" />

<p>With regard to the question of Internal Improvement, independent of the fact, that there is not a solitary expression to be found in the Constitution, in the remotest degree connected with that subject, we have already shewn that on the 18th and 20th of August, a distinct and full proposition to grant that power was rejected by the Convention; and the Committee would here observe that many of the remarks which they have made on the subject of manufactures, will be strictly applicable to this branch of the subject. But in addition to what has been submitted, we have to state, that the following facts are to be found on the journal of the Convention, to-wit: on the 18th of August it was specially proposed to vest in Congress the power <i>to grant charters of incorporation,</i> in cases where the public good may require them, and the authority of a single State may be incompetent.</p><p>To <i>establish a University.</i></p><p>To encourage by proper premiums and provisions the advancement of useful knowledge and discoveries.</p><p>To establish seminaries for the promotion of literature and the Arts and Sciences.</p><p>To grant charters of Incorporation.</p><p>To establish public institutions, rewards and immunities for the promotion of agriculture, commerce, trades and <i>manufactures;</i> and to regulate stages on the post roads. Now, where are any of these powers to be found in the Federal Constitution; and what course of reasoning can entitle them to a place in an instrument purporting to contain nothing but expressly defined powers. But this is not allOn the 14th of September, only three days before the final passage of the Constitution, some still anxious to enlarge the powers of the General Government, after the instrument was presented for the adoption of the Convention, proposed <i>to grant letters of incorporation for canals,</i> c. which was rejected.</p><p>The Committee are aware that the subject is far from being exhausted, but time would fail them to present all the objections which could be justly preferred against the course of the general government. Less could not be said, for the subject is of such growing magnitude, and is producing sensations of such just inquietude among the people of the South, that they ought to be made thoroughly acquainted with all its bearings, and certainly can never be too often admonished to be prepared for the worst events. The Committee are fully sensible that every degree of moderation is due to the question, upon which they have founded the present serious complaint; but they owe it to truth and sincerity to say, that it is their decided opinion an increase of Tariff duties will and ought to be RESISTED by all legal and constitutional means so as to avert the crying injustice of such an unconstitutional measure.</p>

<page id="GA1827.1.P213" no="GA1827.1.214" />

<p>They are constrained too to say, that this State ought to <i>oppose</i> in every possible shape, the exercise of the power, on the part of the General Government, to encourage Domestic Manufactures, or to promote Internal Improvement. They will not pretend, at present, to recommend the mode of OPPOSITION; but they will recommend the peaceable course of remonstrating with Congress on the subject, and of asking of that body to pause before it proceeds any further in measures that most inevitably destroy the affection of some of the States for the General Government. It will detract nothing from the firmness or wisdom of the Congress, to listen to the voice of State Legislatures while it is considering the memorials of <i>manufacturing companies.</i></p><p>If to the contempt of <i>right,</i> there should be added the jealousy of <i>partiality,</i> it must be obvious to all that there will be an increased account of unmerited aggravation. How long a people shall be permitted to complain, or how much they can be made to suffer, has always been matter of dangerous experiment or doubtful calculation; and knowledge acquired under either issue, has never been without its certain and severe regrets. In conclusion, your Committee recommend the following resolution:</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That his Excellency the Governor be and he is hereby requested to cause the foregoing Report to be land before Congress at its next session. And that he forward a copy of the same to each of the other States, to be laid before their respective Legislatures for the concurrence of such as may approve of the principles therein avowed; and as due notice to those who may dissent from the same, that Georgia as one of the contracting parties to the Federal Constitution, and possessing equal rights with the other contracting party, will insist upon the construction of that instrument, contained in said REPORT, and will SUBMIT to no other.</p><p>Read and agreed toTHOMAS STOCKS, President.</p><p>AttestWM.

<page id="GA1827.1.P223" no="GA1827.1.224" />

<p>That an amicable but unsuccessful attempt has, during the present year, been made to ascertain and mark the dividing line between this State and Florida, by a commissioner on the part of the United States, associated with one appointed by Georgia. The failure has resulted entirely from a difference of opinion as to the true head or source of the St. Marys river. By the Constitution of Georgia, obviously and unquestionably founded upon the Treaty of Peace of one hundred and eighty three, and confirmed by the second article of the Spanish Treaty of one hundred and ninety-five, that line was to run from the northernmost part of the thirty-first degree of north latitude, on the Mississippi due east to the middle of the river Apalachicola or Chattahoochie; thence along [Illegible Text] middle thereof to its junction with Flint river; thence straight to the head of St. Marys [Illegible Text] and thence along the middle of that river to the Ocean.</p><p>Many years ago commissioners were appointed under the aforesaid Treaty of one hundred and ninety-five, to run and mark the line above described; this however was not done, but a point was ascertained and marked as being the supposed head of St. Marys river, and distinguished by the name of Ellicott's Mound. Georgia had no agency, it was done by commissioners as before stated, appointed by the United States and the Spanish Government. But Georgia relying on the skill and research of the agents who superintended this important interest always supposed that this Mound might be at the true head or source of the St. Marys river, and has all along contented herself with that idea; but she has never done any act or admitted any principle which absolutely binds her to the observance of that point as the one to or from which said line should run. Upon frequent applications to the General Government to have this line run, it was at last consented to, and on the [Illegible Text] day of May, 1826, an act was passed by Congress for that purpose. But there was a condition in that act to this effect: That the line so to be run and marked, shall be run straight from the junction of said rivers Chattahoochie and Flint, to the point designated as the head of St. Marys by the commissioners appointed under the third article of the Treaty of one hundred and ninety-five, as before mentioned. The point designated was Ellicott's

<page id="GA1827.1.P224" no="GA1827.1.225" type="INFERRED" />

Mound. This act it will be perceived, did not authorise the commissioners to run the line according to the Treaty, but according to an operation which had taken place under that Treaty many years ago, and which has since evidently turned out to be erroneous.</p><p>When the Commissioners proceeded to ascertain and mark the line under this act, it was clearly discovered by them that the true source or head of the St. Marys river, had not been found by the Spanish and American Commissioners at the time they were sent to run that line under the said Freaty of one hundred and ninety-fiveWhen this fact was discovered and [Illegible Text] to the late Governor of Georgia, finding that the United States Commissioner was bound by the act before mentioned, and was not instructed to proceed in the matter according to the Treaty, he suspended all further proceedings, until the General Government and the Government of Georgia could have other and further explanations on this subject. The facts which have led to the discovery of this error, are very plain and satisfactory, and are contained in a document submitted to the Governor by the [Illegible Text] who accompanied the commissioners in their late attempt to run and mark said line.</p><p>Your committee are of the opinion that when the General Government comes properly to understand the true history of this difficulty, it will not [Illegible Text] upon any advantage which may be supposed to result from long acquiescence in the idea that [Illegible Text] Mound at the true [Illegible Text] of the St. Marys river.

Your Committee therefore recommend the following resolutions:</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That our senators and representatives in [Illegible Text] be requested to [Illegible Text] another act of Congress, or an amendment of the one passed in 1826, authorising and directing the commissioners who may be appointed under the same, to proceed with such commissioners who may be appointed by Georgia to run and mark said line according to the true intent and meaning of the said Treaty of [Illegible Text] and to ascertain and determine the true source or head [Illegible Text]

The estimation in which this branch of letters has been held, and the ardour with which it has been pursued in modern days, may perhaps be ascribed to causes accidental and temporary; and if the Committee can be pardoned the seeming profanation, they would consider these accidental and temporary causes the signal interposition of Divine Providence to rescue mankind from that Gothic ignorance and barbarity which so rapidly increased and benighted the human mind, from the decline and fall of the Roman Empire to the revival of letters in the fifteenth century. An examination of these causes is deemed unnecessary; they are facts of historical record, and within the reach of every industrious enquirer. The arguments urged against the practice of making the study of the ancient classics a necessary part of education, are the following, viz: It is urged, the time a boy employs

<page id="GA1827.1.P227" no="GA1827.1.228" />

in acquiring a knowledge of words, as they style the study of the Latin and Greek languages, may be more profitably spent in getting a knowledge of things; notwithstanding his young and tender mind may not be qualified to enter on intricate and abstruse studies, it is able to receive and retain a variety of information that would be useful to him in future life; that in learning a language it is the memory that is chiefty exercised, and that this useful faculty may be as easily filled with important facts as condemned to retain a jumble of foreign words, together with the various rules and exceptions under which they have been placed by grammarians. That Geography, Chronology, Natural History, and works of imagination, may be employed by the instructor to give equal exercise to the memory, and by the greater pleasure they would afford to the pupil, as well as his more perfect understanding of them, they would both improve his other faculties and add to his stock of useful knowledge, and that time would be saved in learning, during childhood, much that must be learnt some [Illegible Text] or other. In these arguments it is assumed as granted, that in the study of the classics the memory is the only faculty improved. It seems to the Committee, that in studying the ancient languages, all the faculties of the mind are actively exercised, and that in this exercise consists the chief advantage of classical education.</p><p>If genius consist in the degree of excellence, attained by all the great faculties of invention, judgment, memory and taste, that system of education must be best which is most likely to give these the utmost degree of improvement, of which they are susceptible. These faculties, scarcely perceptible in the mind of the infant, are gradually developed as the body increases in size and strength; they do not appear at the same time, nor is their progress the same. The memory is in perfection when invention is hardly [Illegible Text] and the judgment continues to improve long after the memory is on the [Illegible Text]hence the discipline adapted to one faculty does not necessarily suit another; now, as by a general law of our nature, every function and power of our body or mind is invigorated by exercise, it should be the object of education to afford to all the faculties that degree of exercise which is essential to their pliancy and [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] this purpose seems to be effectually answered

<page id="GA1827.1.P228" no="GA1827.1.229" />

by the discipline of the Grammar School. An analysis of a boy's mind in translating from an ancient language into his own, will render this more obvious.</p><p>In ascertaining the import of such foreign words and phrases as he does not understand, when he has consulted his dictionary, he often finds them interpreted by numerous English words and phrases, essentially different from one another; in selecting out of this variety that which will best express the meaning of his author, he must weigh, compare and discriminate; and in this employment his judgment is exercised and matured; when the dictionary refuses to afford him the aid he solicits, in his exertion after the suitable and analagous expression, invention and fancy are brought into action. To find out the proper order in which the words are to be arranged in the translation, he must seek that one of the numerous rules of syntax which alone is applicable; and hence arises the habit of <i>abstraction.</i></p><p>When the meaning is ascertained, in selecting from the several synonimous expressions that which is happiest and best, his taste is obviously cultivated and improvedIn short, the whole business of translating a classic author consists in an unremitted exercise of the mental faculties; in perceiving the resemblances or differences of what he observes, remembers or imagines, and no longer than they are exercised can he make any progress. The translation from his own language into Latin and Greek affords similar advantages to the student, with this differencethat it seems to improve his invention and sagacity more, his judgment and taste less, and is less complete in itself. Memory, it is universally admitted, is sufficiently cultivated in learning the classics.</p><p>If we compare the classical with other juvenile studies, it will be found that none will afford the same continued and varied exercise; in Georgraphy, Chronology, and such branches of Natural History as can be learnt from books, the active powers of the mind are suspended and the memory alone is exercised. In the study of our own language, as it is ordinarily taught, the mind is nearly as passive; in the study of Mathematics, the reasoning powers are vigorously and profitably exercised; but they are dormant as to all other relations but number and quantity. In

<page id="GA1827.1.P229" no="GA1827.1.230" />

Physics some useful knowledge may be acquired, and the talent of observation improved, but the reasoning faculties are little exercised, and those of imagination still less; the consequence of this inherent diversity is, that some minds succeed in one study and some in another, as each cultivates the faculty in which it happens to excel: and hence it is that a proficiency in classical learning which requires and implies the improvement of all the faculties of the mind, is more uniformly an evidence of genius, and gives a surer presage of intellectual strength than any other single acquirement.</p><p>During the years of tuition the knowledge of men and things must necessarily be very limited. Nothing but the actual perception of what passes in his own heart and mind, or his observations of the action of others, and the undefinable and ever varying occurrences of life, can impart to man knowledge that will be either useful or accurate; and every attempt to supply the place of experience will prove inadequate and fallacious. Since knowledge cannot be imparted during youth, it is desirable to improve the future means of acquiring it; and even if it could be imparted, it would be better to get talents than information, as every one would prefer the ability of writing a poem to that of remembering it, and be prouder of the skill of a painter than to possess some of his pictures. If we examine the list of illustrious names which have figured on the theatre of government, physics, or letters in England, or in our own country, we shall scarcely meet with one who has not received a classical education; when we find that those whose minds have been thus trained are generally superior in intellectual powers to those who have received a different training, and that those who have been distinguished for the productions of genius agree in nothing more than this mode of instruction; it seems to lead irresistibly to the conclusion that such mode is superior in improving the intellects. Some distinguished examples may be cited in our own country of men who exhibit strong and vigorous minds without the benefits of classical education; but it will be found generally, that such men have had their efforts concentrated [Illegible Text] a single pursuit, that they have manifested only great reasoning powers in a single department of science. Similar but not equal advantages are to be obtained by the

<page id="GA1827.1.P230" no="GA1827.1.231" />

study of modern languages. There is so much resemblance among all improved modern languages, as to the origin of their words, the small number of their inflections and variations, and the greater number of their particles, that they are learnt with greater facility [Illegible Text] the ancient languages, and consequently they afford less exercise and improvement to the mental faculties; as a proof of this, it requires commonly not more months to acquire a modern European language than it does years to acquire a proficiency in Latin or Greek, and he who has once mastered these languages finds the acquisition of all others easy.</p><p>The study of modern languages is not to be regarded as profitless and unnecessary; our sister States have deemed it an essential and important part of juvenile instruction; a proficiency in modern classical literature is viewed not only as an ornament to the mind, but obviously useful in our varied, commercial and political intercourse with foreign Nations.</p><p>With this view of classical learning, it is a source of melancholy regret that so little care should be bestowed by the patrons of our Academies, on this important part of juvenile education. More deplorable is the apparent want of munificence on the part of the Legislature, the assumed guardians of the literary character of the State. With an extent of territory equalled by but few or none of our sister States, with sources of revenue none other can possess, with a climate mild though varied and congenial to the expansion of human intellect; the Legislature hitherto, has refused even a temporary endowment for a professorship of modern languages, and also moral and mental philosophy for the University.</p><p>When we compare the literary character of Georgia now, with what it might have been; when we contrast it with many of our sister States, the votary to science will blush, indeed, at the apathy and indifference to intellectual advancement which have hitherto obscured it. When we see our sister States of the North and East so wonderfully and efficiently uniting capital and intellect for our humiliation and ruin, will Georgia scorn the means which can avert and arrest the approaching triumph and consequent dependence? Will she longer remain supine and in cold-hearted indifference and see these means wrested from her

<page id="GA1827.1.P231" no="GA1827.1.232" />

which can, not only ensure her preservation, but raise her to pre-eminence and distinction? These truths, obvious and incontrovertible, it is hoped, will awaken the guardians of the literature of the State to a sense of our literary degradation, and induce a future appropriation from the funds arising from the sale of public lands, for the permanent endowment of the different professorships which may enable us to sustain, protect and advance our literary and scientific character.</p><p>The Committee recommend the following resolutions:</p><p>R<i>esolved,</i> That the Justices of the Inferior Court and the Trustees of the Poor School Fund of each county, make to the grand juries in the ensuing year, returns of the disbursements of the funds since December, 1825, together with a particular statement of the number of children instructed, their ages, sex, and mode of instruction pursued, and the persons employed as teachers, and that the said returns be forwarded by the Clerk of the Superior Court to the Governor, to be laid before the Senatus Academicus and General Assembly.</p><p>R<i>esolved,</i> That the annexed be the form of a return of the several Academies and Free Schools in this State.</p><p><i>To his Excellency the Governor.</i></p><p>SIR</p><p>Annexed you have a correct return of Academy, in county of for the political year 18</p>

<p>We are aware that our repeated appeals to the General Government upon this subject, so vitally interesting to the people of Georgia, have been looked upon as impertinent and obtrusive; but your Committee believe, that the State has been disposed to suffer in silence, so long as the evils under which she labored were sufferable, and that when her claims shall be fairly investigated, and it is seen how unreasonably they have delayed, an enlightened and just community will pronounce the course she has pursued, to have been marked with great moderation and forbearance.</p><p>We propose in the discharge of our present duty, to enquire <i>first,</i> into the nature and present situation of our claim upon the General Government; and <i>second,</i> to investigate the nature and extent of our title to the territory in question, considered abstractedly from our claim upon the General Government.</p><p>By the 4th section of the articles of agreement and cession, entered into on the 24th of April, 1802, between the Commissioners of the United States on the other part, it was expressly stipulated and agreed, that the United States should at their own expense, extinguish for the use of Georgia, <i>as early as the same could be practicably obtained on reasonable terms,</i> the Indian title to all the lands within the State of Georgia.</p><p>It will hardly be contended, that this was a mere <i>naked promise,</i> and therefore to be violated at pleasure by the United States, for the contract imports upon its face a most ample and sufficient consideration.</p><p>We are not ignorant of the fact, that the General Government having the power in her own hands, is disposed to put her own construction upon this promise, and to make herself the sole and exclusive judge of what may be considered reasonable terms; but we respectfully contend, that if she designs to keep up <i>even the show</i> of justice, she will suffer this to be controlled by the same rule of construction applicable to all other contractsthat is to say, that the <i>words</i> used, shall be understood in that sense which is best calculated to effectuate the true intention of the contracting parties.</p><p>The reciprocal objects intended to be accomplished by the United States and Georgia, by the contract in question, were few and simple. They intended that Georgia should

<page id="GA1827.1.P237" no="GA1827.1.238" />

cede to the United States a vast extent of territory [Illegible Text] described; that the United States should at their own expense, and upon their own responsibility, extinguish for the use of Georgia whatever claim or title the Indians might have to the lands lying within her limits; and that this should be done <i>as early</i> as it could be upon practicable and reasonable terms.</p><p>We consider it certain from the terms of the contract itself, and particularly from the consideration which was paid, that it was the intention of both parties that the Indian title should <i>certainly,</i> at some time or other be extin-guished. The <i>time</i> was left indefinite and uncertainnot because it was contemplated that any circumstance should occur, or state of things exist, that should deprive Georgia of those lands; but, because this State reposed such unbounded confidence in the justice and good faith of the General Government, as induced her confidently to believe that no opportunity would be permitted to escape, and that no fair and honorable exertion would be withheld for the speedy and [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] of the promise.</p><p>We admit that after much anxiety and delay, Georgia is about to reap the full benefit of the contract in question, so far as it regards her lands situate within the Creek Nation of IndiansBut the <i>manner</i> in which this has been accomplished, compels us to say, that we are less indebted to the General Government for the result, than to the exertious of our late able and patriotic Governor. Although Georgia is about to obtain the last foot of <i>Creek</i> lands to which she is entitled, yet it must be remembered that there is still a considerable portion of <i>Cherokee</i> lands to which she has precisely the same title, in relation to which the General Government is under the same obligation, and which nevertheless still remains in the possession of the Indians. By what motive or reason the general government can be influenced. in so pertinaciously and unjustly refusing <i>entirely</i> to redeem her pledged faith to Georgia, we are unable to perceive. The whole civilised world knows, that Georgia acted a gallant and distinguished part during the Revolutionary War, in achieving our liberty and independence; and our [Illegible Text] States will do us the justice to testify, that since that time, Georgia has not withheld her treasure or her sword from the defence of our common

<page id="GA1827.1.P238" no="GA1827.1.239" />

country, and national rights. We mention these things, not by way of boasting, or out of vain glory; but, to show that Georgia has violated none of the obligations by which she was bound to her sister States, and therefore, that there is the less justice in their violating their obligations to her.</p><p>It will be remembered, that the articles of agreement and cession were entered into in [Illegible Text] and that they imposed upon the United States the obligation of procuring the relinquishment of the Indian title, so soon as the same could be done peaceably and upon reasonable terms. Immediately upon the ratification of these articles, it became the duty of the General Government to improve every opportunity that might present itself, and with all her [Illegible Text] and energies faithfully applied, to have <i>sought</i> diligently for opportunities to effect such relinquishment. She did not do soBut on the contrary, manifested so much indifference, and for so long a time, that Georgia became dissatisfied, and took occasion respectfully to call the attention of the General Government to this subjecta liberty which she has several times since found it necessary to exercisebut which has either been treated with silent contempt, or has subjected her to reproach and calumny. That the United States have violated most palpably their contract [Illegible Text] Georgia, we think is made evident, when it is remembered, that since the [Illegible Text] of the articles of agreement and cession, the Indians have been removed entirely from Ohio, Kentucky, North and South Carolina, Tennessee, Missouri, and almost all Arkansas; and that since that time, five or six times as much land as belonged to Georgia, and was in the possession of the Indians, has been acquired in Alabama for the use of the United States, and that too, upon peaceable and reasonable terms; besides large cessions in Mississippi, Illinois, Michigan and Florida. And it is a fact so notorious, that we presume no one will venture to dispute it, that upon the termination of the late war with Great Britain and the Indians, the United States had it completely in their power to procure for the use of Georgia, the principal part of the lands to which she was entitlednot only upon peaceable and reasonable terms, but upon just such terms as they might have pleased to prescribeBut this was not done, or attempted to be done

<page id="GA1827.1.P239" no="GA1827.1.240" />

On the contray, the United States by negotiation, effected for their own use and aggrandizement, large cessions of territory in another part of the nation, and thereby therew the Indians in greater numbers upon our own territory, and so circumscribed their limits, as greatly to diminish the prospect of their willingness to make further cessions, either for the benefit of Georgia or for any other purpose. And since that time, it has been the constant and favorite policy of the United States, not to hold out inducements to the Indians to yield up the possession of the Georgia lands; but to so add to their comforts, and so instruct them in the business of husbandry as to attach them so firmly to their country and to their homes, as almost to destroy the last ray of hope that they would ever consent to part with the Georgia lands. It is <i>now</i> alledgod, we understand, that it is impossible for the United States to obtain the lands in question for the use of Georgia, upon peaceable and reasonable terms; and therefore that they are under no obligation to obtain them at all. By whom and in what way we beg leave to enquire, has this impossibility been produced? Surely by the United States, and by their policy, and that too against the consent and remonstrance of GeorgiaAnd is it possible, that the General Government will consent in this way to benefit herself, and to take advantage of her own acts, and [Illegible Text] too to the injury and oppression of one of her own members? For the dignity and honor of our common country, we earnestly hope not. But although the General Government is under this obligation, and from which she cannot [Illegible Text] release herself in any other way than by complying with it, yet judging from our past experience, we can scarcely venture to hope, that she will redress our injuries and establish our rights. We are [Illegible Text] that this subject engaged the attention of the last Legislature, that the resolutions which they adopted were submitted to the President of the United States; and we are glad that in reply, he condescended to express to our Senators in Congress a <i>wish</i> to gratify the State, but we are sorry that he added negotiation (with the Indians) was hopeless, and that he could not consent to apply force We are at liberty to understand this answer no otherwise, than as a distinct and formal determination, to take no step to obtain for and secure to Georgia

<page id="GA1827.1.P240" no="GA1827.1.241" />

her long delayed rights. We have waited upon and trusted to the justice and [Illegible Text] of the United States for upwards of the fourth of a century, and the result to us is disappointment, insult and injury.</p><p>From this gloomy and almost hopeless prospect, we turn our attention to the second branch of our enquiry, and trust that we shall be able to establish in the State of Georgia a good, legal, and perfect title to the lands in question, and that we have the right, by any means in our power, to possess ourselves of them.</p><p>In the examination of this important and interesting question, we are necessarily carried back to the earliest history of this country. When the continent of America was [Illegible Text] discovered, it was possessed and owned by various wandering tribes of savages; and the discoverers asserted successfully the right of occupying such parts as each discovered, and thereby they established their [Illegible Text] command over it, asserting their claim both to <i>domain</i> and to <i>empire.</i> By <i>[Illegible Text]</i> we mean that, by virtue of which a nation may use the country for the supply of its necessities; may dispose of it as it thinks proper, and derive from it every advantage it is capable of yielding And by empire we mean the right of sovereign command, by which the nation directs and regulates at its pleasure every thing that passes in the country. Precisely in this way, and in no other, did Spain, France, England, Holland and Portugal obtain sovereignty over the portions of this country discovered by each. It may be contended with much plausibility, that there is in these claims more of <i>force</i> than of <i>justice;</i> but they are claims which have been recognised and admitted by the whole civilised world, and it is unquestionably true, that under such circumstances <i>force</i> becomes <i>right</i> This kind of title is not only good and valid agreeable to the laws of <i>Nations,</i> but is perfectly consistent with natural justice. The earth was certainly made for the benefit, comfort and subsistence of man, and should be so used as to accommodate the greatest possible number of human beingsIt was therefore perfectly in accordance with the design of nature, that the densely populated countries of Europe, should possess themselves of the immense forests in America, which were used only as hunting grounds, and employ them in promoting the comforts and providing

<page id="GA1827.1.P241" no="GA1827.1.242" />

for the subsistence of their overflowing population. Acting no doubt upon these principles, Great Britain occupied and colomsed the province of Georgia, the [Illegible Text] of which anterior to the revolutionary war, were defined, and made to extend from the Atlantic coast to the Mississippi, and from the 31st to the 35th degrees of North latitude. The whole of this territory was made to form a provincial government, thus exercising the highest and most unequivocal acts of sovereignty. In this exercise, both of <i>domain</i> and <i>[Illegible Text],</i> on the part of Great Britain, certain portions of territory were reserved for the <i>use</i> of the Indians, and the Indians themselves were declared to be under the protection of Great Britain; and the lands reserved were also under the sovereignty, protection and dominion of that government. Thus it is seen, that the sovereignty of Great Britain over the whole of Georgia was complete and perfect; that the absolute right to the soil was in her; that the Indians were under her <i>protection;</i> and that [Illegible Text] possession was only <i>permission.</i> Things remained in this condition until the revolutionary war; upon the termination of which, by the treaty of peace between the United States and the mother country, the sovereignty to the full extent as claimed, owned and exercised by Great Britain over all the lands and Indians within the State of Georgia, passed to and vested in the people of this State. We have shewn we trust, very clearly, that at the end of the revolutionary war, Georgia possessed, and had a right to exercise absolute control and sovereignty over the whole of the territory lying within her then limits; that her claim to <i>domain</i> and <i>empire</i> was not disputed; that the absolute title to the soil was in her; that the Indians were under <i>her protection;</i> and that their [Illegible Text] was by <i>her permission,</i> as it had previously been by that of Great Britain. Thus far, we [Illegible Text] the premises that we have established, and the [Illegible Text] that we have drawn, will not be disputed; for if they are wrong, the very argument that proves them to be so, must defeat the title by which every foot of land in the United States is held, for they all derive title in the [Illegible Text] way.</p><p>It now remains for us to shew, that [Illegible Text] the revolutionary war. Georgia has done no act, and entered into no compact with her sister States, by which she has divested

<page id="GA1827.1.P242" no="GA1827.1.243" />

herself of any portion of her sovereignty, affecting her rights now in question. And this proposition will be supported, if we can shew that no such consequence can result from the articles of confederation, the federal constitution, or the articles of agreement and cession of 1802.</p><p>To shew that the articles of confederation have divested Georgia of no portion of her sovereignty, it does not appear to us necessary to take any other ground than the very obvious one, that these articles have been abrogated by the Federal Constitution, which was adopted in its place and stead. But we [Illegible Text], that even prior to the adoption of that Constitution, they contained [Illegible Text] provision when properly construed, affecting the right in question. In the articles of confederation we find this provision: Each State retains its <i>sovereignty,</i> freedom and independence; and every power, <i>jurisdiction</i> and <i>right</i> which is not by the confederation <i>expressly</i> delegated to the United States, is reserved to the people of the States. We may search in vain in the articles of confederation, for any <i>express</i> delegation of the right of sovereignty or jurisdiction by Georgia to the United States over the territory in controversy. No such express delegation was ever madethe consequence is obvious; it is reserved to the people of the State. Those who differ with us in opinion, may attempt to sustain themselves by one further provision in the articles of confederationWe allude to the power given the United States of regulating trade, and managing all affairs with the Indians, not <i>members</i> of any particular State, but by express provision this power is in no instance to be exercised so as to infringe or violate the <i>legislative right</i> of any State within its own limits. We are by no means satisfied, but that the Indians resident within the limits of Georgia, may fairly be considered members of the [Illegible Text] if so, the United States possess not the right to [Illegible Text] with them even so far as to regulate trade; but [Illegible Text] they be members of the State or not the United States are expressly prohibited from [Illegible Text] with them in any way so as to infringe or violate the legislative right of the State within her own limits. We think, therefore, that [Illegible Text] articles of confederation have not affected our title in the least.</p>

<page id="GA1827.1.P243" no="GA1827.1.244" />

<p>We next proceed to the enquiry, whether the [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text], and right of sovereignty over the lands in controversy, have been affected by the Federal Constitution; and if affected, to what extent? We are not disposed to afford even the feeble aid of <i>our</i> example for frittering away the Constitution by <i>[Illegible Text];</i> we prefer to take that instrument <i>as it is,</i> and not to take from, or add to its provisions. We have always believed, and yet do, that all powers not <i>expressly</i> granted by that Constitution, or <i>[Illegible Text] [Illegible Text],</i> and <i>necessary</i> and <i>proper</i> to the execution of the <i>[Illegible Text] granted power,</i> are reserved to the States; and we earnestly insist upon this rule of construction, so far as that instrument applies to the subject under consideration.</p><p>In the third section of the fourth article of the Constitution, we find this provision: Congress shall have power to dispose of, and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property <i>belonging to the United States;</i> and nothing in this Constitution shall be so construed, as to prejudice any claims of the U. States or of any particular State. We are unable to see what argument can be fairly drawn from this provision, to shew that Georgia has surrendered up to the United States any portion of her rights so as to affect the present question. This provision not only gives to the U. States the power to control and dispose of the territory or property <i>of the General Government;</i> but it vests them with no power whatever to control or dispose of the territory or property <i>of any State;</i> on the contrary it is expressly stipulated, that in the exercise of this power, the claims of no particular State shall be <i>prejudiced.</i> It will not be contended we apprehend, that since the articles of agreement and [Illegible Text] of 1802, the United States have the smallest shadow of a title to the lands in controversy; and if it were considered necessary, we could easily shew that even <i>before</i> that time, they had no well founded title. There is, therefore, nothing in this part of the Constitution <i>expressly</i> or <i>[Illegible Text]</i> divesting Georgia of the right of sovereignty in question, [Illegible Text] the very fact, that no such [Illegible Text] was surrendered up into the hands of the United States, we are warranted in [Illegible Text] that the right was <i>retained</i> by the State.</p>

<page id="GA1827.1.P244" no="GA1827.1.245" />

<p>We understand that the power which the Constitution confers upon the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate to make <i>treaties,</i> is claimed to have an influence upon the present question; but we are unable to discover any necessary connection between this provision in the Constitution, and the question under consideration. This part of the Constitution, we have always understood, applied to <i>foreign affairs</i> only. We are apprised however, that the United States have treated with various tribes of Indians at different times, and that those treaties have been submitted to the Senate for ratification; but, if we mistake not, since the adoption of the Constitution, Virginia, Ohio, New York, and Kentucky, have exercised the right of treating with the Indians residing within their limits; and their right to do so, has not so far as we know or believe, been disputed. But upon this point we feel no sort of solicitude, for it is sufficient for our purpose, that in the Constitutional provision now under review, there is no <i>express</i> or <i>plainly implied</i> surrender on the part of Georgia of her right of sovereignty to the territory in question.</p><p>If there is any other provision in the Federal Constitution affecting this question, we are not apprised of it. And we consequently arrive at the conclusion, that the rights and powers of Georgia in and to the lands in question, remain precisely where they stood immediately upon the conclusion of the revolutionary war, with the exception, that Georgia has, in common with all the other States, given up to the General Government a portion of her right of <i>empire;</i> but she has surrendered that right no farther in relation to the territory in dispute, than she has in relation to all the rest of her territory. In aid of our opinion upon the question of title, we beg leave to refer to the decision made by the Supreme Court of the United States in the famous case of Fletcher  Peck, which fully establishes the principle, that the Legislature of Georgia, unless restrained by its <i>own Constitution,</i> possesses the power of disposing of the unappropriated lands within her own limits, in such manner as her own judgment may dictate. And the same case establishes the further principle, that the Indian title is only permissive and temporary, and not at all inconsistent with a seisin in fee on the part of [Illegible Text]

<page id="GA1827.1.P245" no="GA1827.1.246" />

We need only add, that this decision was made long subsequent to the adoption of the Federal Constitution.</p><p>By the articles of agreement and cession of 1802, Georgia parted with and gave up all her claims and rights, both of <i>domain</i> and <i>empire</i> to the territory thereby <i>ceded</i> to the United States; but these articles contain no <i>formal</i> and <i>express</i> surrender of any such rights to the territory <i>reserved.</i> We are aware that such surrender is claimed to be <i>implied</i> from the term Indian title as there used. But when the subject is properly understood, we contend that this conclusion does not necessarily result from the premises. This term was not intended, and cannot be understood as building up, and vesting in the Indians, any kind of <i>title</i> to the lands in controversy; nor was it intended to add to, or detract from the title which they already had. It was only used as a term descriptive of that title. We have already seen what that title was; that it was a [Illegible Text] possessory one; and that they had so little interest in the soil that their possession was not inconsistent with a [Illegible Text] in fee on the part of Georgia. But it is contended, that by the articles of agreement and cession, a <i>consideration</i> was contemplated to be paid by the United States to the Indians, for their relinquishment of this title; and therefore that it was of such a character as was entitled to respect, and as could not be taken from them unless by their consent. We are of a different opinion. We have already seen the fragile tenure by which they held, and do yet hold lands; but however slender it may have been, yet <i>some act</i> was necessary to be done by the United States or Georgia, in order to oust them of possession. This act must necessarily have been of either a warlike or pacific character. If of a warlike character, no consideration of a [Illegible Text] nature could be necessary; but if of a pacific character, then the object was to be accomplished by negotiation, and a consideration would necessarily be the result. Whenever it has been necessary to accomplish a similar act with the Cherokees, or any other nation of Indians, by either of the means just mentioned, from obvious motives of policy, as well as humanity, the United States have preferred resorting to negotiation and [Illegible Text] In all such instances, the United States were by no means

<page id="GA1827.1.P246" no="GA1827.1.217" />

<i>bound</i> to resort to such measures: they did so from <i>choice.</i></p><p>This custom was well known to the contracting parties to the articles of agreement and cession at the time it was entered into, and the relinquishment of the Indian [Illegible Text] was intended to be effected in the same way, and the provision in question was simply intended to make the United States sustain all the expense of negotiation, presents, and consideration, which otherwise would have fallen upon Georgia, had she proceeded to the accomplishment of the same object by <i>pacific means.</i> But there is nothing in this provision which <i>prevents</i> the United States or Georgia from resorting to <i>force;</i> on the contrary, this right seems to be admitted, although the United States would not <i>bind</i> themselves to use it. At all events it is evident, that if Georgia possessed this right <i>before</i> entering into those articles, she possesses it yet, for a surrender of it is no where to be found. Before Georgia became a party to the articles of agreement and cession, she could rightfully have possessed herself of those lands, either by <i>negotiation</i> with the Indians or by <i>force,</i> and she had determined in one of the two ways to do so; but by this contract she made it the duty of the United States to sustain the expense of obtaining for her the possession, provided it could be done upon reasonable terms and by negotiation; but in case it [Illegible Text] become necessary to resort to <i>force,</i> this contract with the United States makes no provision: the consequence is, that Georgia is left untrammelled and at full liberty to prosecute her rights in that point of view, according to her own discretion, and as though no such contract had been made. Your committee, therefore, arrive at this conclusion: That anterior to the Revolutionary War the lands in question belonged to Great Britain; that the right of sovereiguty both as to <i>domain</i> and <i>empire</i> was complete and perfect in her; that the possession by the Indians was permissive; that they were under the protection of that Government; that their title was temporary; that they were mere tenants at will: and that such tenancy might have been determined at any moment, either by negotiation or force, at the pleasure of Great Britain That upon the termination of the Revolutionary War, and by the Treaty of Peace, Georgia assumed all the rights and powers in relation to the lands and Indians in question, which heretofore

<page id="GA1827.1.P247" no="GA1827.1.248" />

belonged to Great BritainThat since that time, she has not divested herself of any right or power in relation to the lands now in question, further than she has in relation to all the balance of her territory, and that she is now at full liberty, and has the power and right to possess herself by any means she may choose to employ, of the lands in dispute, and to extend over them her authority and laws.</p><p>Although your committee believe the absolute title to the lands in controversy is in Georgia, and that she may rightfully possess herself of them when and by what means she pleases, yet they would not recommend an exercise of that right till all other means fail. We are aware that the Cherokee Indians talk extravagantly of their devotion to the land of their fathers, and of their attachment to their homes; and that they have gone very far toward convincing the general government, that negotiation with them in view of procuring their relinquishment of title to the Georgia lands will be hopelessYet we do confidently believe that they have been induced to assume this lofty bearing, by the protection and encouragement which has been afforded them by the United States; and that they will speak a totally different language if the general government will change its policy toward them, and apprise them of the nature and extent of the Georgia title to their lands, and what will be the probable consequence of their remaining refractory.</p><p>Your committee would recommend that one other, and the last appeal be made to the general government, with a view to open a negotiation with the Cherokee Indians upon this subjectThat the United States do instruct their Commissioners to submit this Report to the said Indians; and that if no such negotiation is opened, or if it is, and it proves to be unsuccessful, that then the next Legislature is recommended to take into consideration the propriety of using the most efficient measures for taking possession of, and extending our authority and laws over the whole of the lands in controversy. Your committee in the true spirit of liberality, and for the alone purpose of avoiding any difficulty or misunderstanding with either the general government or the Cherokee Indians, would recommend to the people of Georgia to accept any treaty which may

<page id="GA1827.1.P248" no="GA1827.1.249" />

In fact, it might be stated generally, that the actual condition of our navigable streams, and even of our principal market roads, is such, as without exaggeration, would cause in some countries, an insurance [Illegible Text] life, or property, or both, to be effected on them To say the whole, the public spirit in the greater portion of the counties is so feeble, and the state of their several roads is such, as to deprive this Committee of a hope, that even any thing serious is intended in reference to Internal Improvement, it appearing impossible that a member from one section of the State, can sufficiently [Illegible Text] himself of local prejudice, to legislate as well for the whole and the entire interest of our common country, as for the little part that each of us may happen to live in; and it is the more remarkable, when we reflect upon the nature of the oath taken by each member of the Legislature, that he will as a Senator or a Representative, so give his vote and so conduct himself on all questions that may happen to come before him, as in his judgment may appear conducive to the interest of the whole State of Georgia, without allusion to the particular county from which he may have been chosen. In more particular reference to this matter the Committee would beg leave to take a [Illegible Text] notice of the Savannah river, being the oldest stream used in the State as a navigable water, and consequently the more frequent subject of experiment and one of the best calculated to test all speculation on the several subjects which have been referred to this Committee by your honorable body; and what is stated in the succeeding paragraphs will be found more or less applicable to all the navigable streams of the State of Georgia.</p><p>Speaking then of the Savannah river as an indication of the condition of the other public waters of this State, that it is a subject of [Illegible Text] and general [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] the whole of our citizens, one way or the [Illegible Text]your Committee are of [Illegible Text] that the trade between the [Illegible Text] of Savannah and Augusta, affords the case in point;

not only because of the needful despatch so necessary to commerce of every kindbut also, because of the additional expense incurred, both in the transportation of produce down the river and intended for foreign parts, and in the transportation of imports to their respective places of [Illegible Text]. For the several articles of import sent as they are to meet and answer our articles for export, must at last be paid to the full extent(first cost, ordinary commissions and the duty) by the <i>consumers.</i> And with regard to the extraordinary expense that the growers of produce sustain by the present state of the roads, the Committee beg leave to draw your attention to the following remarks in Mr. Fulton's Report of last year, (page 52.)</p><p>Whatever facilities are afforded to a State by improvement, beyond what it possessed in transporting its produce to market, is so much labor or money saved to that State; for the article of cotton, for instance, will bring as great a price in a foreign market when more [Illegible Text] transported in that State, as it would have done if those improvements had never existed. Hence it becomes obvious that whatever saving takes place, goes [Illegible Text] the pockets of the <i>growers,</i> and not into those of the consumer These circumstances [Illegible Text] it all important to the agricultural portion of this community, that the freight to and fro should be as light as possible, and moreover, that all additional increase of expense upon the first cost should be spared to our people It is also the opinion of your Committee that the several bars in the Savannah and other rivers may arise from the second cause mentioned in the Engineer's Report They are of opinion that a geological change is constantly taking place in the beds of these rivers, from the manner of cultivation pursued by holders of land upon the margins of our principal navigable streams; and that no other proper [Illegible Text] can be applied, but that of dredging or excavating the soil, which may have so accumulated, and of [Illegible Text] the current to some channel recommended by some scientific and practical Engineer, and according to the mode prescribed by him; and would refer to the Documents accompanying this Report, marked A. and BYour Committee also beg leave to state that Georgia, from the wide extent of its territory [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] and large preportion of [Illegible Text] soil, its genial [Illegible Text] commodious [Illegible Text] and navigable

Among the various measures that [Illegible Text] of course occupy its attention, that of Internal Improvement, will doubtless receive its due share of consideration. Certainly [Illegible Text] can be more immediately and vitally connected with the prosperity of this country, than a wisely devised system for that purpose. By Internal Improvement, is here intended a [Illegible Text] practicable enterprise, limited in its application to the [Illegible Text] parts of the State; adapted to the wants and [Illegible Text] of all its citizens, poor as well as wealthy' [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] to the resources of the State, and to be carried [Illegible Text] from year to year, without risk of exhausting the treasury, or hazarding the [Illegible Text] of [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text]</p><p>Among the causes that have combined in retarding the [Illegible Text] of this State, and fertile in pernicious consequences, one is, its destitution of good [Illegible Text], of cheap, convenient and secure channels for the conveyance of produce to markets from the [Illegible Text] and remote parts, as this [Illegible Text] leads to an oppressive and disproportionate expense, and operates as a discouraging and depressing force on the industry of the country.</p>

<p>In the existing state of [Illegible Text], the transportation of one [Illegible Text] the distance of one hundred miles, taking an average through the year, costs one dollars; of a [Illegible Text] of cotton of the usual weight, three dollars, or from one-eight to on tenth of its total value. If one hundred bushels of corn were sent that distance, the freight would reach the [Illegible Text] amount of fifty dollars; or the price of sixty-six bushels, if sold at seventy five cents per bushel, which is probably a fair average for the low country market; manifestly precluding the culture of corn in the parts [Illegible Text], except for neighborhood consumption.</p><p>One hundred thousand [Illegible Text] of cotton from the interior of this State, annually [Illegible Text] a market at various points of our sea coast, or at [Illegible Text] The freight of this transpartation cannot be rated lower than three hundred thousand dollars per annum. And if all points of the State be included in the estimate, and a fair allowance made at the same price, for the amount of merchandise forwarded inward, the injury inflicted yearly on the agricultural [Illegible Text] of the [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text], may be seen in its just magnitude and its disastrous consequences, become apparent to the dullest understanding</p><p>While cotton commanded a market at from 12 to 20 cents, the mischief above noticed, was little regarded; but it acquires a graver character and claims a more serious consideration, when viewed in connection with the present circumstances and future prosperity of the cotton grower in this country.</p><p>But a few years ago, the Southern States of the Union monopolised the market of Europe for cotton; its culture however, has since been extended over an immense and annually [Illegible Text] area, in Asia, Africa and South America. Hence from the operation of causes, resistless in their course as the step of destiny; viz: the vastly increasing production of cotton, and the natural impossibility that consumption, starting from this time, can keep pace with production; it becomes self evident that the price of that article must find a level still lower than that at which it now stands</p><p>It is equally plain, that the cost of freight will hold an increasing ratio to the value of produce until that reaches its minimum; and also, hat when that charge bears a certain high ratio to the value of production, it compels the

planter to direct the whole or a share of his industry to articles less heavily burdened. The corn cultivation of the back country is in this situation.</p><p>In the present state of the business the cotton planter who sends his cotton to a distant market, pays one bale out of 8 or 10 for carriage; but when it shall have sunk to six cents per lb the point at which, from the circumstances of the world, it will probably become stationary; it will then cost him one bale out of every five or six.</p><p>These views and conclusions, without advancing pretensions to minute accuracy, are in the main sound, and although affording no sufficient motive for despondence, they certainly do for serious and salutary reflection; they lead to the conviction, that great and persevering effort is demanded to relieve the industry and capital of the country from the pressure and disadvantages against which they now have to contend.</p><p>If Georgia is to prosper; if she is to retain her present stand; if she is to be preserved from declension, this is indispensableotherwise much of the wealth and enterprise of our citizens will seek other soils, where their means can be more profitably employed; this evil has, and to no small extent, already happened; indeed, the early adoption of the system recommended, appears to be not so much a measure of mere expedience as of necessityIf it be wisely planned, and skilfully and faithfully [Illegible Text], it will accomplish all that its advocates promise.</p></blockquote></p><p>The [Illegible Text] resources of the State that may be considered applicable to works of internal commercial improvement, may be estimated as follows: the amount of [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] now in the Treasury, and all the money due the State on account of bonds, accounts and other evidences, and all that may arise from the future sale of lands and other public property not otherwise appropriated. In the application of these resources, several separate and distinct resources present themselves.</p><p><list><item><p>1st The most certain mode of gaining a given quantum of improvement at the least probable expense to the State.</p></item><item><p>2d.

<item><p>3d. The method most likely to attain these improvements, and consequent benefits.</p></item><item><p>4th. The necessity of making this method a permanent appendage of the government.</p></item></list></p><p>The first of these considerations presents these points; contracts, hired labor, and slave labor; contracts hitherto made in this State with individuals, have uniformly been attended with disaster and defeat; it is now deemed almost a licentious use of the public Treasury to place it in the hands of any contractor, unless he will submit to a constant and responsible supervision of his labor, which destroys the very object of all such engagements. [Illegible Text] labor is objectionable from its uncertainty and expensiveness; uncertain from the constant liability to desertion and forfeiture of their obligation by those who can be induced to be thus employed; expensive from the enormous price demanded by that class of our population whose labor can be thus obtained under the necessary restrictions to ensure a fulfilment of their promise. It is demonstrable that such laborers cannot be procured at a less price than one dollar per day; this price, suppose two hundred laborers were employed, would amount to upwards of sixty [Illegible Text] sand dollars per annum; a sum almost or quite equal to what that number of slaves would cost. Admit for argumentand to make the comparison they cost eighty thousand dollars, twenty thousand would clothe, [Illegible Text] and effect a life insurance at 4 per cent. and allow a legal interest on the capital vested; the expense would [Illegible Text] be as twenty to sixty or clear gain to the State of forty thousand dollars in favor of slave labor; this computation is not idle conjecture, but is accurately made and is in perfect accordance with the clothing and subsistence of the United States' soldiers.</p><p>The Committee are aware of the objections that may be urged to the introduction of so large a number of slaves into the State without any regard to character; these objections and fears are more imaginary than real when it is considered from the nature of their employment, they will have to be divided into a number of small parcels and superintended by vigilant overseers, and moreover, that there are many persons in the State who employ an equal or greater number of slaves daily on their plantations without any other immoral or disastrous incidents

than are common to this peculiar class of our population, however isolated.</p><p>2d. The improvements necessary for the permanent prosperity of the State are natural and artificial</p><p>3d. Natural improvement consists in removing logs, snags, roots, sand bars and other impediments, to the free navigation of the several rivers in the State, and confining the water in the main channel, so as to afford boatable water at all seasons of the year These improvements are deemed of primary importance, for on the [Illegible Text] and permanency of this water transportation will depend the value and utility of artificial improvements; these are, canals, rail roads, and turnpikes; and are to be selected with a due regard to economy and facility afforded. Assuming the estimates of Mr. Fulton, the Civil Engineer.</p><table><tr align="LEFT" valign="MIDDLE"><td>One mile of canal will cost</td><td align="RIGHT">$10,768</td></tr><tr align="LEFT" valign="MIDDLE"><td>Annual expenses, including interest,</td><td align="RIGHT">1,439</td></tr><tr align="LEFT" valign="MIDDLE"><td>Making the sum of</td><td align="RIGHT">[Illegible Text]</td></tr></table><p>Transportation of 1 ton for 20 miles, will be [Illegible Text].</p><table><tr align="LEFT" valign="MIDDLE"><td>Wooden [Illegible Text] roads with iron plates, as is proved by the experiments made in Pennsylvania at Mauch [Illegible Text], will cost per mile</td><td align="RIGHT">$2500</td></tr><tr align="LEFT" valign="MIDDLE"><td>Annual expences, including intrrest,</td><td align="RIGHT">907</td></tr><tr align="LEFT" valign="MIDDLE"><td>Making the sum of</td><td align="RIGHT">$3,407</td></tr></table><p>Transportation of one ton 20 miles, 61 1-4 cts. making a difference of 39 3-4 [Illegible Text] for every [Illegible Text] miles in favor of the rail roadSee Mr. Fulton's report for last year, page 29.</p><p>The Committee are aware of the difference in durability of the two modes of improvements, but it is confidently believed, that [Illegible Text] all the circumstances, that rail roads will be found the most practicable and useful, at least for the middle and up country. When it is known that by the process of charing, as simple as it is easy, the durability of timber can be increased almost to half a century; a [Illegible Text] rail road with [Illegible Text] plates, the timbers well coated with [Illegible Text] oil and common glue, and then covered with newly made and finely powdered charcoal, would remain sound and firm for upwards of thirty years.</p>

<page id="GA1827.1.P260" no="GA1827.1.261" />

<p>The Committee are supported in their position, by an experiment actually made in [Illegible Text] in England, where the posts prepared in the manner before prescribed, have [Illegible Text] under water for twenty years, without the wood becoming the least moistened</p><p>The experiment seems so conclusive and so much to the point, that the Committee beg leave to recommend it seriously to the consideration of the superintending authority for the Internal Improvement. Turnpike [Illegible Text] are so little known in this State, that the Committee have no satisfactory data by which they can estimate their comparative advantagss. From an estimate furnished by the Civil Engineer, he cost would be sixteen hundred dollars per mile in the sections of country most favorable for their construction. [In confirmation of this estimate, your Committee refer you to Documents C and D] In many parts of the [Illegible Text] they would be impracticable from want of materials, or [Illegible Text] at such an [Illegible Text] price as to make it unwise to attempt them</p><p>The Committee are aware of the argument that may be urged in opposition to any general system of Internal Improvement, that the planter can transport his own commodities to market in his own waggon.</p><p>This argument more specious than true, will be [Illegible Text] on the slightest examination, if the price of transportation be in proportion to the capital and time employed, and that it is so, surely no one will question; then certainly the loss is equal, [Illegible Text] we convey our cotton to market in our own waggons, or engage those of our neighbor. In addition to this, it will lessen the number of horses in our country; one of the most expensive appendages of a plantation The Committee are unwilling to leave this subject, without adverting to the immense amount lost to the citizens annually, by the present system of transportation. Assuming as the fact, (and it is far short of truth) that three hundred thousand dollars are expended annually for the transportation of the products of the country market; that of return merchandise may be safely estimated at two hundred thousand moremaking a total of expenditure incurred for carriage on the existing plan, of five hundred thousand dollars By [Illegible Text] road conveyance, it would not exceed one hundred thousand dollarsThus

realising an absolute increase of wealth to the country; equal to four hundred thousand dollars.</p><p>4th. The plan most likely to attain these objects, will consist in a well organised Board of Public Improvement; to this Board should be intrusted the disbursement and disposal of all money that is now, or may be hereafter appropriated for the Internal Improvement of the State. They should be allowed to keep in their employ a well practiced Engineer, with a suitable salary, and as many assistants as in their opinion the public service may require; they should have power to direct the survey of any river or route for a canal or rail road, turnpike or other roads that may be deemed necessary for the public use and convenience, and may cause the same to be placed in a suitable condition for use, whenever appropriations may be made to enable them to effect it; and have power to purchase all the necessary implements which in their judgment may be useful and necessary. The Committee are aware, that objections may be urged to the organization of a Board with such plenary powers. But when it is considered, they have the control only of the funds appropriated for Internal Improvement, these objections loose their force, and the intelligence of the Legislature can but conclude, that it is much safer to trust their Internal Improvement funds to persons, however few in number, who are personally known to tham, who have been selected from the great body of their fellow citizens for their talcuts, zeal, fidelity and discretion; and who are annually accountable to them for the faithful performance of their trust, than to persons known only by name, owing no responsibility, who may have been selected more from favoritism, than any manifestation of ability or desire to serve them, or to persons who may seek such appointments, more from a hope of personal aggrandisement, than a regard for the common [Illegible Text]. With these conclusions, the Committee cannot see any good and valid reason why a Board of Commissioners for Internal Improvement should not be made, and become a permanent part of the Government. If precedent be sought, it will be found in all of our sister States who have made advancement in practical improvements for facilitating transportation from the interior of their respective territories.</p><p>The General Government have deemed the organization of such board, indispensable to the success of any

enterprise for facilitating interior transporation. If we wish for proof that the plans hitherto adopted are inadequate and fallacious, we need only [Illegible Text] to our rivers where thousands have been expended, and the result, disappointment and vexation.

With a mind of great capacity and highly replete with the most useful and practical skill in his department, he would constitute an efficient arm to the Executive of any Government, and his loss will be an occurrence long to be deplored by Georgia in her present exigency.

<law id="R1827V1N186" initial.page="264"><p>IN SENATE, Dec. 19, 1827.</p><p>The Joint Committee on the State of the Republic, to whom was referred that part of the Governor's communication, and the documents that relate to the prohibition by the General Government, of the survey of the territory acquired by the Treaty of the Indians Springs, and the threatening of military force to coerce obedience to the same, have had the same under consideration, and beg leave to REPORT:</p><p>That the Committee believe, they are warranted in stating that there was no necessity, on the part of the General Government, for this inconsiderate act of power, even though it had been legitimate. In giving the reasons for this belief, any other than a plain but decided language, consulting alone a proper self-respect, is deemed unadvisable, for it must be to the tameness of former remonstrances that we are indebted for such repeated acts of aggression. As is remarked by Gov. Troup, the controversy with the general government was to all appearances happily terminating at the close of the last session of the Legislature. But the Indians, under the guidance of a well known subtle influence at home, and emboldened by an equally undue encouragement abroad, have set up the insolent and insulting pretention that they are an independent people and have lost no opportunity to have that claim recognised by the General Government and duly respected by ours.</p><p>On the 12th of January last, while the Surveyors of Georgia in the discharge of duties assigned them by law, were surveying for the purpose of disposition, the lands acquired by the Treaty of the Indian Springs, a number of Indians styling themselves chiefs and head men of the Creek Nation, demanded of them in writing, to desist from stretching a chain over any of their lands; at the same time wresting from them their instruments and threatening personal violence. This demand was communicated to the President by their Agent, and calling upon him for his interposition to protect them in their rights, as secured to them by the Treaty of Washington.</p>

<page id="GA1827.1.P264" no="GA1827.1.265" />

<p>The President, resolving to declare the Treaty of the Indian Springs, a nullity, and to make the fact more mortifying to Georgia, determined to announce it to the public authorities of the State, upon the complant, and at the sole instigation of the Creek Indians, and lest this bold attempt should be misunderstood, for the want of that emphatic character which belongs to arbitrary measures, directed the Secretary of War to say to Governor Troup, that he considered the Treaty of Washington as the supreme law of the land, and charged by the Constitution with the execution of the laws, he should feel himself compelled to employ, if necessary, all the means under his control, to maintain the faith of the Nation by carrying that Treaty into effect.</p><p>Under a step so decisive, there was left to the Governor but one course, and it becomes matter of earnest congratulation to the country that it was promptly taken, to <i>resist</i> such an unwarrantable assumption.</p><p>It will be readily perceived, that the whole difficulty turned upon the validity of these Treaties. The measures pursued by Georgia, and the rights asserted by her councils, in relation to this often and much agitated question, placed the Governor exactly in the point, where he had to sustain the undivided force of the coutest, or leave all the previous policy of the State subject to the censure of illtimed weakness, or what is worse, to the just reproach of idle infatuation.</p><p>The clamor which was early vented against the Treaty of the Indian Springs, and its negotiators, by the Indians, and not a few designing white men, called the [Illegible Text] of the Legislature of Georgia to the subject, and accordingly, after the most deliberate investigation of the charges against its validity, we find that body unanimously declaring that the Treaty contains in itself intrinsic evidence of its own fairness in the liberal and extended provisions which it contains for the removal, preservation and perpetuity of the Creek Nation, and that the confidence of the State remained unimpaired in the honor, uprightness and integrity of the Commissioners</p><p>This solemn avowal, made by all [Illegible Text] seemed in good faith, to have imposed upon all [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] most unqualified pledge to support this Treaty, and the Committee

<page id="GA1827.1.P265" no="GA1827.1.266" />

cannot but believe, if it had been more faithfully observed among ourselves, that it would have produced less opposition abroad; for distracted councils never fail to invite the indulgence of selfish power, or provoke the encroachments of artful ambition.</p><p>The Indians not content, however, with the provisions of this Treaty, than which none can ever be more advantageous to them, called upon the general government to abrogate it, and without the consent of Georgia, after her rights had absolutely vested. This has been done, in what is called the Treaty of Washingtonan act, which the Committee conceive, involves between the two governments an obvious question of sovereignty. The Committee believe the proper distinction has never been taken between the power to treat and the proper subject matter of TreatyThe first has never been denied, but it is denied that the rights of States can be treated away. This question does not belong to either to decide, but is a subject alone to adjustment by fair negotiation, and to all the assertion of right which eitheir party may choose to maintain. Accordingly in December, 1825, we find the Legislature of Georgia declaring that full reliance is and ought to be placed in the Treaty lately concluded between the United States for the use of Georgia and the Creek Nation of Indians, at the Indian SpringsThat the title of the territory obtained by said Treaty within the limits of Georgia, is considered as an <i>absolute vested interest,</i> and that nothing short of the <i>whole territory,</i> thus acquired, will be satisfactory, and that the right of entry immediately upon the expiration of the time limited in the treaty, be insisted on and accordingly carried into effect.</p><p>This declaration so unequivocal in its character, and coming from a sovereign State, who conceived something at least due to their grievances, though denied to their rights, was totally disregarded, and instead of opening the way to an adjustment of its differences with the general government by friendly negotiation, seems to have increased the spirit of opposition on the part of that government, and what was refused to us was promptly accorded to the Indians. They were met and treated as an independent nation, and in the January following they obtained a recession of part of that very land, in which, but the

<page id="GA1827.1.P266" no="GA1827.1.267" />

month before, the highest authority of Georgia declared they held an absolute vested interest.</p><p>Unwilling yet to increase or continue the causes of controversy with the general government, the Legislature of Georgia at their last session, in the most respectful manner remonstrated against the course which had been pursued, invoked that government to review it measures, and earnestly entreated it to forbear the exercise of powers against which Georgia had so repeatedly protested; at the same time asserting that Georgia owned exclusively the soil and jurisdiction of all the territory within her present chartered and conventional limits, and that the attempted abrogation of the Treaty of the Indian Springs, by the Treaty of Washington, in so far as it divested the State of Georgia of any right acquired under the former is illegal and unconstitutional.</p><p>This remonstrance, instead of inducing the President to pause, and of inspiring a proper sense of respect for the earnest expostulations of the State, seemed to have no other effect than to add fresh impulse to an hostility that had already gone beyond the limits of either prudence or justice. And that nothing should be wanting to place the course of the general government clearly without the range of doubt or mistake, the President communicated to Congress on the 5th of February last that the act of the Legislature of Georgia under the construction given to it by the Governor of that State, and the surveys made or attempted to be made by this authority beyond the boundary secured by the treaty of Washington to the Creek Indians, are in direct violation of the supreme law of the landand this unqualified opinion, unaided by the weight or authority of any other branch of the government, either legislative or judicial, was thundered forth in the self-same message that declared the singular fact, that the question was about to be submitted to the <i>tribunals of justice</i>But as if impatient of the result which might possibly flow from sober councils and the wonted discretion of legal enquiry, a light in which the subject had not often been considered, and at the same time to overawe all dispassionate investigation of an opinion so hold in its character and <i>seemingly</i> so determined in its purpose, it was distinctly announced that, if the <i>legislative</i> and executive authorities

<page id="GA1827.1.P267" no="GA1827.1.268" />

of the State of Georgia shall persevere in <i>acts</i> of <i>encroachment</i> upon the territories secured by a solemn treaty to the Indians, and the laws of the Union remain unaltered, a superadded obligation, even higher than that of human authority, will compel the Executive of the U States to enforce the laws and fulfil the duties of the nation, by all the <i>force</i> committed for that purpose to his charge. And this ill judged, not to say impotent threat, was repeated in a letter from the Secretary of War to the Governor of Georgia, as already mentioned, and that it should lose nothing of the effect imposed by a military pageant, it was delivered by an officer at arms.</p><p>This plain history of the high-handed authority asserted by the President and accompanied with a menace, which in the absence of firmer means is the usual resort of undecided purpose, presents but one intelligible conclusion.</p><p>If the legislature meant any thing by its several acts disposing of the territory acquired by the treaty of the Indian SpringsIf they meant any thing by approving of the conduct of the negotiators of that treatyIf they meant any thing by declaring that they had an absolute vested interest created by said treaty, and that nothing short of the whole territory thus acquired would be satisfactory, and that the treaty be insisted on and carried into effectIf they meant any thing by asserting that Georgia owned exclusively the soil and jurisdiction of all the territory within her limits, and that the attempted abrogation of the Treaty of the Indian Springs was illegal and unconstitutional. This Legislature cannot but conceive that it became the bounden duty of the Governor to consider the <i>whole transaction</i> as an invasion of our vested rights, offensive in its manner, and not warranted by any principle of justice, meriting that hearty defiance which belongs to a people peculiar for their submission to constitutional authority, but equally remarkable for their opposition, in every shape, to tyranny and usurpation And that he ought to have been prepared to resist the invasion of a vested interest as well in the unsettled territory acquired as in the heart of the oldest settlement of Georgia. Accordingly Governor Troup in reply to the Secretary of War, on the 17th of February last, declared that he felt it to be his duty to resist to the utmost any military attack which the

<page id="GA1827.1.P268" no="GA1827.1.269" />

government of the United States shall think proper to make on the territory, the people or the sovereiguty of Georgia, and all the measures necessary to the performance of this duty, according to our limited means are in progress. From the first decisive act of hostility you will be considered and treated as public enemies, and with the less repugnance, because you, to whom we might constitutionally have appealed for our defence against invasion, are yourselves the invaders, and what is more, the unblushing allies of the savages whose cause you have adopted. This course is altogether approved by the committee, and what is extremely gratifying, seems to be justified by most of our considerate sister States; and the [Illegible Text] of the Governor, is the more satisfactory, because, unlike some recreant threats that are made for <i>effect</i> and <i>intimidation,</i> it was backed by a preparation so grave and determined, as to relieve it from all suspicion of being <i>idle</i> or <i>unmeaning.</i></p><p>There is a circumstance connected with this subject, as the committee conceive, of such honorable disinterestedness, as to make it a matter of lively concern to present it to the consideration of the Legislature. In carrying into effect the orders of the President for the arresting of the public servants of the State, in the strict and faithful performance of a duty imposed upon them by the laws of their country, and subjecting them to the expense and exposure of a public and vexations prosecution, the agency of the District Attorney became necessary, and was therefore demanded. That office, it is well known, had been and was then ably discharged by our esteemed fellow citizen Richard W. Habersham, Esq. a native Georgian, feeling and believing that his State was most unnatually harrassed, and unwilling to be the organ of outrage to her rights, or an instrument of oppression to her citizens, he resigned into the hands of those, who were unable to approciate such an act of [Illegible Text] a trust which could no longer be held, as he conceived, without disgrace to them and disgust to himself.For this example of rare patriotism, (and it is not too much to say rivalling many of the deeds of Roman virtue,) he has been most illiberally denounced at home and abroad, by the advocates of an administration more beloved for its patronage than respected for its principles,

<page id="GA1827.1.P269" no="GA1827.1.270" />

and whose affection for its cause is measured by its success alone. Such an officer and such an instance of self-denial merits the gratitude of Georgia, and deserves and receives the thanks and approbation of this Legislature.</p><p>Read and agreed toTHOMAS STOCKS, President.</p><p>IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, <i>December</i> 24, 1827.</p><p>Read and concurred inIRBY HUDSON, Speaker.</p><approvaldate /></law></part>
