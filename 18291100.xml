And further, that it is not only practicable but that the intervening country affords unusual facilities

<page id="GA1829.1.P208" no="GA1829.1.211" />

for continuing the Canal, at a moderate cost, from the Ogeechee to the Altamaha, at a point near the mouth of the Ohoopie; and that there is little reason to doubt, if hereafter it should be deemed advisable, that it may be extended along both branches of the Altamaha to Macon and Milledgeville, and even beyond those places into the interior, thus affording to a large and productive portion of our State a certain, ready, and cheap mode of transporting its valuable staples to a market on the sea board, and an equally cheap, ready and certain supply, in return, of such foreign productions as may be necessary for the convenience and comfort of its people.</p><p>Like all similar attempts elsewhere, when first made, the Directors of the Savannah, Ogeechee and Altamaha Canal Company, have had great obstacles to overcome; the inexperience of the projectors, the want of competent Engineers in our own State, and the difficulty of procuring such from abroad, the ignorance and miscalculations and failures of sub-contractors, and above all, the difficulty of procuring proper labourers in the section of country in which the work was commenced, were not only productive of great embarrassments and delay, but tended to increase the actual cost much beyond the original estimates, and also probably much beyond the cost of any future similar undertaking in our State, where like facilities are afforded by nature. It appears by the report of the Engineer, made to his Excellency the Governor, under date of the 6th instant, and herewith submitted, that the amount expended on the section of the Canal which connects the Savannah and Ogeechee rivers, is $143 721 56 cents, and that nearly all the locks, sluices, culverts, bridges and check-dams are completed and only about forty chains of excavation and embankment remained at that time to be made; and it further appears by that report, that the residue of the work is to the entire completion and filling of the Canal, including an addition of 20 per cent. for contingencies, will not exceed the sum of $20,949, while, by an account rendered by the Treasurer of the Company, three days after, and which is also herewith submitted, it appears that there was then in its Treasury, to meet this expense, the sum of $25,735, leaving a surplus in cash, after the Canal shall have been completed for navigation, of nearly $5000, thus insuring to the State the completion of this first attempt of Canalling in Georgia, and thus also bringing under the immediate eye of her people, a means of internal communication, which has contributed so much to the wealth, prosperity and importance one State of our Union, and the benefits

<page id="GA1829.1.P209" no="GA1829.1.212" />

of which are now so eagerly sought after and in part realised by several of the others. This work, so important in its probable results to our people, the President of the Company, in his communication to the Governor, under date of the 12th instant, which is also herewith submitted, confidently expresses the hope, will be completed in March next, for the passage of boats. While alluding to this letter of the President, your committee feel that it is due to the liberality and public spirit of that gentleman, to state, that although entitled to a salary of one thousand dollars per annum, which is affixed to his office, he has constantly refused to receive any compensation whatever, and has heretofore, and will continue, to render his services gratuituously to the company.</p><p>Your committee are aware, that the immediate benefits to be derived from the completion of the section of the canal between the Savannah and Ogeechee rivers, will be felt only by a small portion of people of the State, but yet they deem them to be very important, as a market will be opened by a safe, cheap and short conveyance, not only for the cotton and other produce raised on the Ogeechee, but also for the immense quantities of valuable timber on both sides of the river as high up as Louisville, and which is now comparatively of little or no value. But when your committee look forward and consider this canal as the first successful trial of a system, for the execution of which nature has furnished to Georgia such uncommon facilities, and which is destined at a day, as your committee hope, not very distant, to diffuse wealth and prosperty even through the most remote and sterile sections of our State. Your committee cannot but view the successful completion of this small beginning as an event of great importance to her whole people.</p><p>In relation to so much of the line of the proposed canal as extends from the Ogeechee to the Altamaha, your committee beg leave to report, that the President of the company, with the sanction of the Directors, applied in the summer of 1827, to Judge Wright of New-York, one of the most, if not the most able and experienced canal Engineers in the United States, either to undertake himself, or to recommend some capable person to undertake a survey of the country between those rivers, and to fix upon the most eligible and practicable line for the canal; that Judge Wright himself declined to act, but recommended Mr. Alfred Cruger, as a gentleman in whose judgment and qualifications he had implicit confidence: that accordingly Mr. Cruger was engaged and came to Savannah in the latter part of that year, and [Illegible Text]

<page id="GA1829.1.P210" no="GA1829.1.213" />

proceeded carefully to examine the country, and to locate the canal; that after having devoted a sufficient time to the examination, and collected the necessary information, he returned to New York, and prepared a report of the result of his researchers, together with a drawing of the plan of the canal and a map of the country through which it would pass, which, with his estimates of the cost of the work, were submitted to Judge Wright, who, after a careful examination of the whole, recommended the same as entitled to perfect confidence. <i>That</i> report, with the plans and maps, were, in the fall of 1828, transmitted to the Executive of this State, and are submitted herewith by your committee, who concur in the belief that they are entitled to the fullest confidence.This survey cost the company $2735 02, which sum has been paid out of its funds.</p><p>From the examination and report of Mr. Cruger, it appears that the canal commencing at the Ogeechee, where the Savannah canal joins that river, and terminating on the Altamaha, at or near the mouth of the Ohoopie, will be a few chains more than fifty-eight miles in length, and will require a feeder from Cox's mill-falls, on the Ohoopie, which may hereafter itself be used as a canal, of a few chains more than fourteen miles, making the whole length of excavation necessary, seventy-four miles and seventy-four chains, which, with the bridges, locks of brick, c. and all other expenses to the entire completion of the canal, is estimated to cost $621,156 60. The dimensions of this proposed canal are intended to be thirty-three feet wide at the bottom, five feet depth of water, and a water line of forty-eight feet, and which are calculated to pass boats of eighty tons. Your committee also state that it appears from the report, that there is in dry seasons abundance of water, even at the summit level for the supply of the canal, that the soil through which the canal will pass, is invariably sand, with a clay bottom, which last is generally [Illegible Text] with at three feet from the surfacethat the ground is free from rock and uncommonly favorable, and that the country presents unusual facilities for the execution of the workthat the whole distance from the Altamaha to the city of Savannah, by the canal, is only seventy-two miles, exceeding by very little the distance by land from its mouth, on the Altamaha, to Darien, while this last distance by water is believed to be nearly three times as great.</p><p>Your committee, in order to enable them properly to estimate the advantages of such a canal, have sought information

<page id="GA1829.1.P211" no="GA1829.1.214" />

from such respectable sources as they believed they could implicitly rely on, and have ascertained, that during the last year there were shipped from Macon alone about forty-five thousand bales of cotton, which, they understand, will probably be increased this year to fifty-five, and that from the borders of the Ocmulgee, below Macon, and not included in the above, about twenty thousandthat the quantity shipped from Milledgeville, and from the country below that place, was last year not less than ten thousand bales, making an aggregate of eighty-five thousand bales, which no doubt will soon be increased to one hundred thousand, exclusive of a considerable quantity forwarded by waggons to Augusta and Savannah, from those waters and their neighborhood, all of which would no doubt go through the canal when completedthat in addition to this, the line of the proposed canal passes through a country covered with forests of the most valuable timber, all of which would find a market by that channel, and that on the other hand the canal would furnish a cheap, certain and expeditious means of supply to a vast extent of rich and populous country, of such articles of foreign production as are necessary for the convenience and comfort of its inhabitants. The distance from the mouth of the canal, by the canal to Savannah, is estimated by Mr. Cruger to be only one-third of that by the river from the same point to Darien, to which last is to be added the whole distance from Darien to Savannah, by the sea-board navigation; and he also estimates, upon data, which appear to your committee to be correct, that on a return cargo of eighty tons by the canal, including the tolls, will be only thirty-nine dolsixty-two cents for every twenty miles, while the same cargo, by the upward navigation on the river, for the same distance, would cost one hundred and seven dollars eighty cents, making a saving by the canal on eighty tons of $68 87 1-2 cents for every twenty miles. If to this be added the time saved in reaching a market and receiving returns for produce, the delays from low waters and the dangers of river navigation, the great saving by canal transportation, over that by rivers, must be manifest to all. On the whole your committee cannot but concur with the late Governor in the opinion expressed in his message, that of the practicability of the proposed canal, and of its immense utility when finished, no reasonable doubt can exist.</p><approvaldate>Approved, Dec. 19, 1829.</approvaldate></law>

It is high time that Georgia should know her boundary lines, that she has a right to the occupation of her land to the true line which separates it from the Territory of Florida as well as the jurisdiction thereof all must admit: that the line to be run directly from the junction of the Flint and Chattahoochie rivers to the source or head of the St. Marys river, is the true line of division, is as certain as it can be made by treaty stipulation, is beyond all qeustion. There really ought to be no difficully in settling the matter.

independant sovereignties, it would appear to the committee to leave no room for controversy. It is useless for this committee again to enter into an argument of the question in relation to the location of this line. So full and so perfect a view of the same was presented in a report of the committee on the State of the Republic, at the last session of the Legislature, to whom that subject was referred, that it is only necessary to refer to that report to establish the truth and justice of our cause, and fully to sustain the course which the State is pursuing relation to that matter.</p><p>The mere quantity of acres, or strip of land between the two lines independently considered, is unimportant either to this State or the United States, and is not the main question to be considered; it is principle, it is mere right for which Georgia contends, and she will be satisfied with nothing less. The Legislature has no constitutional power to give up or barter away the territory or citizens of the State, or any portion thereof or relinquish her jurisdiction over the same, but on the contrary to preserve inviolate the integrity thereof.</p><p>The committee were hopeful that the application and appeal which was so respectfully and directly made to the justice and good sense of the Congress of the United States, by the Legislature of this State at its last session, would have removed all difficulty on this subject, and closed this unpleasant and unprofitable controversy.</p><p>The United States can certainly have no wish to do injustice to any one of the members of the Confederacy, and Georgia on her part solemnly disclaims all intention of even a wish to obtain either from the United States or Florida an acre of land, to which her claim is not sanctioned by equity and justice her duty as well as her most earnest desire, is to cultivate the most friendly feelings towards the United States and also towards Florida, and would exceedingly regret that she should be reduced to the necessity of pursuing any measure that would be calculated for a moment, to interrupt those good feelings that now so happily subsist between them. And the committee take this occasion to State that they have much confidence in the liberality and justice of the Congress of the United States, and the Administration of the Government thereof, and are from this consideration induced to believe that the want of time prevented the Congress from acting definitively upon the subject at its last session, and not from a disposition to disregard the rights of

the State, or leave the question still open. They are induced once more earnestly to appeal to the Legislature of the Union upon this subject, and request that they, at the ensuing session of Congress, repeal or alter and amend the act passed on the fourteenth day of May, eighteen hundred and twenty six in relation to the running and marking the said line, and make provision for, and appoint commissioners on the part of the United States, to act in conjunction with commissioners to be appointed on the part of Georgia to trace out and plainly mark the line between Georgia and the Territory of Florida from the junction of the Flint and Chatahoochie rivers to the true head or source of the river St. Marys, according to the intention, letter and spirit of the second article of the treaty of friendship, limits and navigation between the United States and Spain, of the twenty seventh of October seventeen hundred and ninety five, without restriction as to the point or mound designated by Mr. Ellicott or any other person.</p><p>The committee, for effecting the object embraced in the foregoing report, recommend the adoption of the following resolutions:</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That Congress be earnestly requested to repeal or alter and amend the act of the 14th of May, 1826, for running out and marking the line between Florida and Georgia, and make provision for and appoint commissioners on the part of the United States, to act in conjunction with commissioners to be appointed on the part of Georgia, to run and mark the said line, agreeably to the 2d article of the treaty between the United States and Spain, before referred to, as specdily as will suit the convenience of the United States.</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That should Congress, at its ensuing session, refuse to make any provision for running the aforesaid line, in conjunction with the authorities of Georgia, that his Excellency the Governor be authorised and requested, as soon after the adjournment of Congress, or as soon after as he shall have ascertained that they have acted definitively upon the said case, as the same can be done with convenience, to appoint commissioners, with a competent surveyor and artist, to run and mark plainly the line aforesaid, according to the provisions contained in the 2d article of the said treaty between Spain and the United States, of the 27th October, 1795.

In doing this they were subjected to many difficulties; they had no certain means within their reach of ascertaining the then population of the counties, a population always fluctuating, and changing in a remarkable degree, and they were left in doubt by the previous Legislature, as to the mode of estimating that population, for the charter had used only the word population, without designating whether it intended the representative population or only the white population. These difficulties and embarrassments were further increased by the immense number of notes offered for discount on the first offering day, they amounting in the whole to nearly nine thousand and accompanied by thousands of certificates all of which the Directors were necessarily compelled to examine and scrutinize before a selection or apportionment could be made; and all of which was to be done by three Directors, between Tuesday morning and Saturday morning, the time at which from the pressure of the applicants and the great inconvenience to which many of them were subjected, the Directors had promised to commence the payments. Thus hurried and pressed, mistakes could not be avoided, and when upon a final closing of their discounts at five o'clock on Saturday morning it was found that mistakes had been made, which could not be rectified, without a re-examination of the notes and certificates, the Directors concluded to allow these errors to remain, until by an amendment of the charter, and by the attainment of a more correct knowledge of the population of the several counties, they would be enabled in future distributions to do equal justice to all. For further and more minute information on this subject your committee beg leave to refer the Legislature to a communication made by the President of the bank to the chairman of this committee under date of the twelfth instant, which is herewith submitted, marked B.</p><p>By the charter of the bank the Directors are required to discount bills of exchange, and in pursuance of this requirement they have availed themselves of the funds which remained in the bank, including those assigned to particular counties and not called for either in whole or in part, which would otherwise remained unproductive to the State.The application of this fund in this mode, while it does no injustice to those counties, which had already received their due apportionment, was productive of great advantage to the bank and of course to the interests of the State, so deeply involved therein. By enabling the directors to place funds at Savannah. Augusta and other points, which would

<page id="GA1829.1.P223" no="GA1829.1.226" />

be received in lieu of specie by those presenting the notes of the bank for payment, a draw of specie from the bank, otherwise unavoidable, has been prevented, while the State has realized by this operation, a profit on a fund which would otherwise have remained unproductive of one thousand eight hundred and seventy-eight dollars and fifty-four cents. Indeed so essential do your committee conceive this mode of discount by bills, to be to the credit and safety of the bank, that they respectfully recommend that a portion of the funds of the bank be hereafter set apart and appropriated exclusively for this purpose. If this is not done, the bank to sustain its credit will soon be obliged to purchase specie at a heavy expense or to stop payment; while on the other hand specie funds by this operation may not only be obtained without cost, but in fact perhaps at a profit to the State. Nor will the counties which have not called for their apportionment be deprived of their rights by this use of the [Illegible Text], for as the discounts run only sixty days the fund can always be restored when it may be wanted. Before concluding this branch of their enquiry, your committee would remark that while it was found impracticable to distribute the discounts of bills among the counties as provided for in the case of notes discounted the Directors have strictly adhered to the limitation of two thousand five hundred dollars, by discounting no bill of exchange beyond that amount.</p><p>Your committee have also deemed it to be their duty further to enquire into the specie operations of the bank, and find that no specie has been drawn on any occasion from the bank, except in the ordinary transactions of the till, where the drafts have been small, except in a single instance of a draft of two thousand dollars by an individual going out of the State and that consequently the original amount of specie in the bank has been diminished but little. The specie funds of the bank, as contradistinguished from specie, have been considerably diminished by calls or demands from the State Banks, the Marine and Fire Insurance Bank, and individuals in Augusta. These demands the parties had a right to make, and a compliance with which could not be refused without material injury to the credit of the institution. And here your committee would take occasion to remark that when the Central Bank commenced its operations it had a large amount of paper of other banks of this State in its vaults, a portion of which it became necessary to convert into specie and for the whole of which they could have demanded payment in specie; but that the Directors of the Central Bank, with a just and prudent regard to the interests

<page id="GA1829.1.P224" no="GA1829.1.227" />

of the State, and aware that the State was a large stock holder in several of those banks, determined not to create an unnecessary and injurious pressure upon those banks, and therefore, limited their demands for specie to only such an amount as they believed could be spared by the banks without inconvenience. In pursuance of this just and liberal policy a circular was addressed to the President of the several Banks, a copy of which is herewith submitted marked C, and the requirements of which were met in the same liberal spirit in almost every instance.</p><p>Your committee beg leave to add that the Central Bank is in a safe and wholesome condition; that on the tenth day of December instant, it had in circulation only two hundred and sixty-three thousand four hundred and nine dollars of its notes; while at the same time it had in specie and specie funds to redeem that amount, the sum of three hundred and ninety two thousand eight hundred twenty-nine dollars and fifty-two cents.</p><p>Your committee cannot conclude their report without expressing their approbation of the zeal, ability and perseverance which has been displayed by the Directors and officers in the management of the affairs of the bank from its establishment to the present time, and would respectfully recommend them as entitled to the full confidence of the Legistature. All of which is submitted.</p><approvaldate>Approved, Dec. 19, 1829.</approvaldate></law>

The soundness of the currency of the State depends upon the prudent and judicious management of the banking institutions by those to whom they are confided, and the value attached by the public to the paper or bills issued from them is a criterion which fully tests that soundness.Whenever a paper dollar is considered by the holder as one of silver or equal to so much of the precious metals, no fear of depreciation exists, and none need be apprehended, and a preference is given to this medium from the conviction that a demand for gold or silver will be immediately complied with and the bill redeemed.</p><p>The Planters Bank of Georgia like other institutions of the State, has had much to contend against from the fluctuations in commerce, its frequent reverses and the embarrassments in which those who have been largely engaged in commercial pursuits have been involved.

The depression of our commerce, the depreciated prices of the staple commodities, the monopolizing spirit which characterises the times, as these causes operate on individual prosperity, in a like ratio affect institutions which afford to the merchant, the farmer, and the mechanic the medium from which his enterprise receives its reward, and his industry its profit. This Bank, like other institutions of the State, has to exercise a watchful eye on the schemes of brokers, whose avarice and love of gain suggest devices and stratagems against which laws are feeble barriers and oaths but weak restraints. The Bank of the United States too, wielding an immense capital, with powers more dangerous and imposing than ever were intended to be granted by the States, has, and will, during its corporate existence, have a blighting influence on the State institutions, which will be felt, as that influence is used by those who direct its operations and regulate its intercourse with the State institutions. A Bank which so orders its emissions of paper as never to weaken public confidence in their being redeemed with specie, may be considered in a sound state. Too much legislation on the monied corporations of any country has never had a beneficial influence either in promoting their credit or strengthening their solvency: the reverse of the proposition may be considered, and it has been demonstrated even in our own State, that a Bank may sink under legislative enactments. Your committee are of opinion

<page id="GA1829.1.P232" no="GA1829.1.235" />

that the Bank of the State of Georgia, with its various branches, affording a large portion of the circulating medium of the country, has been faithful in the performance of its engagementshas extended its usefulness without endangering its creditand has aided in affording facilities to trade which prudence warrants. The fidelty, ability and good faith of agents and directors are the true supports of the character and conduct of Banks, and if the individual stockholders, who are materially interested, feel a reliance and confidence in those agents, the public seldom have cause for any distrust. Your committee are satisfied that the Bank of the State of Georgia has been managed with a view to the State and individual interest.</p><approvaldate>Approved, Dec. 19, 1829.</approvaldate></law><law id="R1829V1N202" initial.page="235"><p>IN SENATE, Dec. 17, 1829.</p><p>The Joint Committee on the State of the Republic, to whom was referred so much of the late Governor's message as relates to the several resolutions of the States of Louisiana and Missouri, proposing certain amendments of the constitution of the United States, beg leave to Report,</p><p>That they have given to the same the most respectful consideration, not only as to their operation upon the Union generally, but as to the effect which their adoption may have upon the interests of the Southern States in particular. It was with regret that your committee found itself compelled to consider their operation in this two-fold point of view, because there is nothing in either of the resolutions which in itself could be calculated to awaken the jealousy of any particular section of the Union; and because, emanating as they do, from the Legislatures of States, whose population is almost wholly agricultural, and where, like our own, slavery exists, your committee feel much diffidence in making the suggestion, that their adoption may prove eventually injurious to those interests. The people of the slave holding States cannot but be aware that there is in the other States an influence already great, and daily increasing, composed of various

<page id="GA1829.1.P233" no="GA1829.1.236" />

materials, but bound together by a common feeling, which has for its object, and even now seriously threatens, not only to destroy the prosperity of the Southern slave holding States by subjecting them to tribute, but to prostrate their political strength, and to deprive them of inestimable privileges now secured to them by the Federal Constitution. In evidence of the existence and power and operation of this influence, your committee will, without going into detail, refer to the late tariff acts: The various amendments proposed to the constitution, in different quarters, with a view to the abolition of slavery: the open and daring operations of abolition societies: and the more secret and disguised, but dangerous movements of the colonization society: the effects already produced in Maryland: and the disperate struggle now in eventful progress in the State of Virginia. Against this influence, the Constitution of the United States is our only safe guard, and the strength of that Constitution rests upon the respect of the people, which will increase or diminish as the alterations of its provisions are less or more frequent. If then its provisions are such as to secure us a present good, why change them in the hope of a better? or why change them, from the apprehension, perhaps groundless, of a future evil, and by thus destroying its sanctity in the eye of the people, risque a greater present mischief?In making these remarks, your committee would not be understood to mean that under no circumstances ought a change in the constitution to be made, but only to intend that in their opinion it is not the true policy of the slave holding States to attempt or make amendments, unless the evil to be remedied shall overbalance the danger and mischief which may result from frequent amendment, by which its sanctity will be diminished. The result is that your committee do not believe that it is the true policy of Georgia to propose or concur in any amendment of that instrument, unless the existing evil is such, as while it calls for immediate correction, that correction will certainly be secured by the proposed amendment. With these general remarks, which are made without particular reference to the proposed amendments in question, your committee will proceed to consider in the first place the amendment recommended by the Legislature of Louisiana, and which proposes, that the first section of the second article of the constitution be so amended that the President and Vice-President of the United States shall hold their offices for the term of six years, and that the President shall be ineligible afterwards.Your committee are aware that many evils have and may hereafter grow out of the Presidents being eligible for more than one term of office. The

<page id="GA1829.1.P234" no="GA1829.1.237" />

love of power, so natural and so strong in man, must operate in almost every case to induce an individual, once elevated to that office, to adopt such means as may be beet calculated to secure a re-election; and the means resorted to may not always be the most honorable in their character, or may in fact, be mischevions to the country. The frequent recurrence too of the election may, by the extraordinary excitement produced, be injurious in its effects not only to the morals of the people, but to the Legislation of the nation, and may eventually endanger the union of the States. On the other hand, the restriction to one term of office, and the extension of that term, may, while it does not ensure the correction of the existing evils, produce others of equal, and perhaps of greater magnitude; and may, while it attempts to prevent corrupt practices to secure a re-election, exclude the strong inducement to a faithful discharge of duty, which is presented by the prospect of a re-election. That the frequent recurrence of the election is calculated, and does produce a frequent recurrence of great and perhaps dangerous excitement cannot be denied; but your committee doubt, by the proposed amendment, although that excitement would not so frequently occur, whether, when it did occur, it would not be greater in proportion to the increased magnitude of the object to be obtained. By the necessary postponement of the period at which a disappointed minority may hope to elevate themselves into power, and a disappointed candidate look to the gratification of his ambition. Independently, however, of these considerations, your committee would suggest that the frequent recurrence of elections secures to the people a powerful control over the public servantsthat it enables them to remove, without an inconvenient or perhaps dangerous delay, a servant who misuses or abuses his trust, while a greater duration of office would postpone this all-powerful corrective to a distant day, and compel the nation to submit in quiet to unqualified or evil rulers, or resort to the remedy of frequent impeachmenta remedy which would, in all probability, produce more dangerous excitement than any resulting from the most contested election.</p><p>For the reasons then that it is impolitic in the slave holding States to amend the constitution, unless the evil be great and the remedy certain; that although from the imperfection of all human institutions, the existing provision is productive of some mischiefs, yet that the proposed amendment may increase them, be productive of others equally great or greater, and is no certain corrective of those which already exist; and that while it will deprive the people of that control over their servants which is secured by frequent

<page id="GA1829.1.P235" no="GA1829.1.238" />

eletions and short terms of office, it will not probably protect the nation against evils as great and of like character with those which are alleged to result from from frequent elections, your committee cannot recommend a concurrence with the resolution of the Legislature of Louisiana in the proposed amendment.</p><p>Your committee will now proceed respectfully to examine the amendment [Illegible Text] by the resolution of the Legislature of Missouri, [Illegible Text] proposes to amend the constitution of the United State [Illegible Text] as to provide a uniform mode of electing the President [Illegible Text] Vice President throughout the United States, and to give [Illegible Text] the people of the United States the privilege of voting [Illegible Text] for the President and Vice President, without the intervention of electors, <i>reserving</i> to the States <i>respectively,</i> their due weight in relation to said election, as is now guaranteed to them by the constitution; and that the election of President and Vice President should in no case whatsoever be submitted to the decision of the House of Representatives of the United States.</p><p>In considering the propriety and policy of this proposed amendment, the committee had reference to the same views of the policy which they have expressed in the earlier part of this report, and were operated upon by the additional consideration that the last part of the resolution has a direct reference to the alteration of that provision of the constitution which was in convention so strongly insisted upon by the representatives of the smaller States, and the adoption of which secured, under certain circumstances, to the weaker States, an equality of power with the greater States in the election of the President. By that provision, as amended, if either candidate shall have a majority of the whole votes of the electoral college, then a selection is to be made from the candidates having the highest number of votes, not exceeding three, by the House of Representatives, voting by States, and each State having one vote.</p><p>Now while your committee believe that great evils have resulted, and that greater may grow out of this mode of making a final selection of a President, from among the candidates, by the House of Representatives, yet, as by this provision, the small States have an equal voice with the large States, under the circumstances named in the election of President, it would be in the opinion of your committee impolitic in those States to relinquish that privilege, in any amendment which may be made to the constitution, unless

<page id="GA1829.1.P236" no="GA1829.1.239" />

in that amendment there be a provision securing to the small States, in the new mode of final decision which may be adopted, an equal weight with the larger States. By the proposed amendment of the Legislature of Missouri, such an equivalent is neither suggested or insisted upon, and therefore, on that account, deem it inexpedient to recommend a concurrence.</p><p>While however your committee deem it inexpedient to concur, for the reason mentioned, yet they would not be understood to dissent from the main principle contained in the resolution, that the election of President and Vice President ought to be made by the people, without the intervention of electors; for such an alteration in the mode of election your committee would approve of<i>Provided</i> it can be so regulated that the sovereignty of the States be not invaded, and the weight of the States, and the present basis of representative population be retained according to the existing provisions. If an amendment to vest the election directly in the people, with these guards to the rights of the States generally, and the slave holding States in particular can be framed, your committee would readily concur in recommending its adoption; for your committee cannot overlook the fact, that by the intervention of electors, the votes of a State may be given in a direction not willed by a majority of the people, that with all the guards so carefully thrown around the electoral college by the constitution, to shield it against corruption, still, as the result of the election of electors can in many cases be anticipated long before that election, these electors may go corrupted into the college, and the will of the people, in the choice of their chief magistrate, be defeated. That great evils have and may again be produced by the mode of election now existing, your committee believe that few persons in the south will doubt. We have witnessed the extraordinary fact, that an individual has been elevated to the chief magistracy, not only against the will of a majority of the people, but against the will of a majority of the States, and we have felt and experienced the mischiefs resulting from that elevation: and if a change can be made by which such an occurrence can again be prevented, without at the same time affecting the right now secured to the smaller States, such change ought to be made. Your committee however, would here remark, that the election above referred to did not result from the principle of giving to each State an equal vote, but from the mode in which the constitution prescribed, that it should be exercised, by which the Representatives of at least one State were enabled to elect the President contrary to

<page id="GA1829.1.P237" no="GA1829.1.240" />

the will of the majority of their constituents. While, therefore, your committee would retain the principle, they would recommend a change in the mode of its exercise if practicable.</p><p>With these views, your committee would recommend the adoption of the following resolutions:</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That the General Assembly of the State of Georgia does not concur with the General Assembly of the State of Louisiana, in the proposal to amend the constitution of the United States, so as to extend the term of office of the President and Vice President to six years, and to render the President ineligible.</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That the General Assembly of the State of Georgia does concur with the General Assembly of the State of Missouri, in the proposal to amend the constitution of the United States, so as to provide a uniform mode of electing the President and Vice President throughout the United States, and to give to the people of the United States the privilege of voting directly for the President and Vice President, without the intervention of electors<i>Provided</i> such alteration can be so made that the sovereignty of the States be not invaded, and the weight of the States, and the present basis of representation be retained, according to the existing provisions of the constitution.</p><p><i>And be it further resolved,</i> That in the opinion of this General Assembly, it would be desirable that the constitution of the U.

To counteract and defeat their operations, is to be effected by pursuing an open and decisive opposition, which is supported by the best interest of our country, and every sentiment of honorable and correct feeling. That this opposition should be tempered with mildness and [Illegible Text] is necessary, so that those who are supporters of the tariff may be convinced that it is the opposition of judgment, of reason, and of patriotism, and not of passion. That it is an opposition which has for its end the preservation of the constitution, the harmony of the Union, and the safety and security of our institutions. That it is one which will not cease, although it may be for a time unsuccessful; and that it will rise with renovated strength from every defeat, so that it finally will unite not alone the sympathies, but the action and concert of those who are situated even amidst the monopolists, but are not actuated by their avaricious and grasping spirit. To enter into an investigation of the principles upon which the tariff was imposed, would be to travel over a wider range of discussion than your committee [Illegible Text] and

<page id="GA1829.1.P239" no="GA1829.1.242" />

to account for the motives which produced the importunate petitions to Congress on the subject, would only be to analyze combinations which were formed from impure motives, and moved to action from interested and selfish principles. The frequent and reiterated accusations made against the Southern States, are only in accordance with the plan of proscription, which the manufacturer would carry into effect against all who denounce their system and support their denunciations by an appeal to facts irresistible and conclusive as any postulate of the mathematician. It has been said, and truly said, we cannot compete with the manufacturers of England, and that the American System, a term which was adopted to mislead and confound, and given for the attainment of political objects and office, would, in its prosecution, compel its sponsors to resort to all those petty arts, which, with honest men, produce disgust, and bring defeat and disgrace upon even practical and beneficial measures, when thus supported. The dense and idle population of old and corrupt governments require resort to ingenuity to employ their surplus population. A young and vigorous country, with its energies active, and its resources unbounded, needs not the exercise of Legislation to direct its labor, its skill, or its ingenuity. With its geographical limits extensive and unexplored, the march of mind left free, finds in its progress the attainment of its desires, which, in older and narrow boundaries would seem mere visions of imagination or Utopian dreams, sketched by the pencil of the philosopher, or the ideal picture of poetic fancy. The wilds which American perseverance has penetrated and rendered the smiling and fruitful abode of elegance, of case, and of refinement, evince that the spirit which would subdue such difficulties craves not the fostering power of Legislative patronage to [Illegible Text] vast manufacturing establishments to pamper overgrown wealth, [Illegible Text] nurture inordinate avarice. The manufacturers of America enter the field of competition under the most unfavorable auspices when contrasted with those of Great Britain, and this arises not from the constitutional and fair opposition which their spirit has provoked, but from the very fact that they are kept in operation alone by Legislative enactments, while the manufactures of Great Britain have large capitals, the whole of which are employed in their factories, and the machinery has been rendered perfect by time, experience, practice, and all the science which human ingenuity has for centures brought to their aid. The sub-division of labor increases the beauty, durability aud perfection of the raw material when manufactured, and gives employment to their surplus population. In a young country like the United States, fortunes have been made and capital

<page id="GA1829.1.P240" no="GA1829.1.243" />

created by the industry of individual exertion, and has not descended, increasing and applied to one object, for centuries, as is the [Illegible Text] the old and settled Kingdom of Great Britain. Labor too is cheaper there, for here, with extensive and fertile lands, inviting to agriculture, the hardy and industrious son leaves the sport of his nativity, and, supported by his adventurous spirit, is found amidst forests, which were deemed impenetrable, and in a short time the rudeness of nature gives place to the beauties of art, and yields to the industry of man. Unlike other countries where vast domains are in the possession of a few lordly landholders, here each citizen can acquire more soil than he can cultivate, and may exercise his art or his science in making it productive and prefitable. But it would be unnecessary exhaustion of time to reason on the disadvantages, the disastrous consequences, and the baneful effects produced from the tariffto pile reasons upon reasons, to add arguments to arguments, would not convince those to whom they are addressed: the manufacturer of woolens, of cotton, of iron, and of hemp would turn a deaf ear to every suggestion of wisdom, though it carried upon it the impress of patriotism, nay, of divinity itself, their sole, their only answer to argument s, will it be to our interest, will it add to our wealth, will it conduce to our power to repeal a law represented so odious in its features, calamitous in its effects, and oppressive in its operations, blighting and destroying like a moral siroc the labors of the agriculturist? If the sympathies which should bind the people of this Union together are invoked, we are accused of maintaining doctrines dangerous to its existence, and propagating opinions treasonable and disorganising. No course can be pursued but will be misrepresentedno measure adopted but will be distorted; but we are bound by every principle of self-preservation to persist in an opposition to a system calculated to reduce the Southern States to a villeinage more odious than the colonial bondage, under which they once groaned. A system which imposes taxes upon every article we consume, and every product we grow, the extent and duration of which is as unlimited as the desires and the avarice of those for whose benefit it was enacted is fostered and sustained. Your committee feel confident that a meek spirit of submission, silent and acquiescent would receive the unqualified approbation of the monopolist and the praises of the timid, the weak and the wavering; but it would only strengthen more firmly the inroads of power, and rivet more close by the chains which gall and fret us. They would respectfully recommend a firm and steady resistance to the tariff, and an adherence to the solemn pledge which we have

<page id="GA1829.1.P241" no="GA1829.1.244" />

given to resist, by all constitutional means, this [Illegible Text] infringement of our rights, assuring to our sister States, who are [Illegible Text] to the measure, that we will give free and warm cooperation to every pain which insures not the modification, but a total repeal of the protecting system.Your committee therefore recommend the adoption of the following resolution:</p><p>Whereas the tariff act of 1828 is partial and onerous in its effects, operating as a tax upon one section of the Union for the benefit and promotion of the other, impoverishing and rendering unproductive the industry of those who do not seek legislative aid, and distroying gradually and perceptibly those sympathies which have united the remotest extremities of our country, rendering her respectable in peace and formidable in war. And whereas the State of Georgia is anxious that her rights should not be yielded, or her assent given to any act dangerous to the harmony of the whole, for the advantage of the few, which is uncalled for by the situation of the country, our foreign, or domestic relations, destructive of that mutual interchange of feeling between foreign countries and our own, annihilating our commerce, diminishing our revenue, and destroying the value of our agricultural products, and making this most fertile portion of the Union as unproductive as a barren waste:</p><p><i>Be it therefore resolved by the State of Georgia, in General Assembly met,</i> That our Senators be instructed, and our Representatives requested to use their best efforts and their warmest co-operation in obtaining a total repeal of the tariff act of 1828.</p><approvaldate>Approved, Dec. 19, 1829.</approvaldate></law>

A concise review of this policy may be productive of some good, and cannot be productive of any harm.</p>

<page id="GA1829.1.P265" no="GA1829.1.268" />

<p>All experience has shown that the association of the white man with the red has generally, if not uniformly, proved injurious to both. This fact is deemed conclusive as to the propriety of a separation.</p><p>But if any thing more were necessary to demonstrate the necessity of a separation, it would be found in the fact that neither the General Government nor missionary societies can prosecute their benevolent purposes concerning the Indians, without serious obstacles, so long as there may be a free association of Indians and white men. It is too manifest to escape observation, that white men of abandoned characters are most apt to associate with Indians, and to exert a baleful influence on their morals and their counsels. The strength of the reasoning on this head is greatly increased when it is recollected that many of the Indians occupy positions in which they will be always exposed to collisions with the state authorities. Indeed, it may be assumed as a fact, that the State Governments never will consent that any tribe of Indians shall exercise the powers of sovereignty within the chartered limits of the States; that they will have to submit to the State laws, or remove beyond their limits.</p><p>Much may be said on original principles concerning the rights of the States in this regard, but these are considered as questions no longer open for discussion: they have been settled by the usages of Europe and Americaby judicial decisions, and Legislative enactments. The Supreme Court of the United States long since decided that the Legislature of Georgia, in 1795, had the power of disposing of the unappropriated [Illegible Text] within its own limits. At a subsequent period it decided that titles to lands in this country rested on the right of discovery. This right residing (with some modification perhaps,) at the time of the American revolution, in the government of Great Britain, was conquered from that country, by the American arms. Subsequent to that period, it has been strengthened, in a number of instances, by conquests over different tribes of Indians; for instance, the Cherokees in 1791, and the Creeks at a later period. These tribes, with others, have been permitted to enjoy a mere occupancy of their lands, chiefly for the purpose of haunting, and have been taken under the guardianship of the United States; but this occupancy, merely permissive, and this guardianship, merely gratuitous, have in no wise destroyed the rights of the States, individually or collectively. If some of the States have accepted or engaged the aid of the General Government, for the purpose of extinguishing Indian

<page id="GA1829.1.P266" no="GA1829.1.269" />

titles, this may enable them to avoid the trouble and expense attending the extinguishment, but does not destroy their own right to extinguish.</p><p>One of the best illustrations of civil or political right, in relation to Indian lands, is obtained from a compilation made by the Rev. Dr. Jedediah Morse, acting as an agent of the General Government, in his report and appendix to Mr. Secretary Calhoun. From these it appears, more especially from the authority of an eminent lawyer, quoted at page 279, that the Indians are entitled to a limited or qualified property in the soil, a right to occupy and enjoy, under certain modifications, but with no power to convey, nor indeed to do any other acts of ownership. The right of soil, or the absolute property, and the jurisdiction over it, belong to the State. The interest in the soil carries with it the right to buy off, or otherwise remove, the incumbrance of Indian occupancy. This right of the State is full and absolute. Even if the hunter State should be changed for the agricultural, the Indians are entitled to no more of their territories, after the change, than is requisite to give them, from cultivating the earth, a support equal to that which they derived from their whole territory, in the hunter State.<i>Morse's Report, p.</i> 68. Such is a substantial statement of some of the leading principles of customary law as it bears upon the situation of the Indians.</p><p>Should it be said that the right of disposing of their soil; the right of jurisdiction or of prescribing the rule of action in their territories; and the right of removing their occupancy, constituting the sovereignty over their territories, belong to the Union, and that the Indians have not been left at the mercy of the individual States; it may be answered that the sovereignty over the Indians and Indian lands in the territories of the United States, if not in the new States, formed as they are from the territory of the Union, may be accorded to the General Government; but the rights of the old thirteen, sustained as they are by law and by adjudication, will never be abandoned.</p><p>The Committee on the State of the Republic, reserving the right of giving, in another report, if necessary, a more full exposition of the laws and usages concerning Indians, have, on the present occasion, only given such a brief view of those usages as will place the policy of the General Government in stronger relief before the nation.</p>

<page id="GA1829.1.P267" no="GA1829.1.270" />

<p>Such being the usages concerning Indians, the policy adopted by the General Government is clearly proper, at least so far as it is intended to induce them to remove, beyond the limits of the States, or to withdraw from those limits; and to extend to them, in some favorable position, the aid and protection of the government. The advantages resulting from a location beyond the limits of the States depend on an exemption from the mischievous intercourse of bad white men, and from the collisions of rival sovereignty, and upon the unobstructed exertions of the government, and various benevolent associations, for their benefit. In this view of the subject, it is not wonderful that the religious public are beginning to use their exertions to promote emigration to the delightful region beyond the Mississippi; for however the son of the forest may be entitled to the rights of humanity, and however the States may be disposed to avoid collision with the General Government, in relation to Indian affairs, a dependent situation within the States is attended with evils too obvious and too serious to be overlooked. These evils to the Indians might be greatly enhanced by the manner of exercising the power, entering into the composition of sovereignty, of buying off, or otherwise removing, the permissive occupany of the territory claimed by them: for although the President of the United States has given a guarantee of this occupancy, it is not perceived that this guarantee rests on any valid foundation; and it may therefore be presumed that it will ultimately be withrawn, when the President shall have reviewed the whole ground, including the exposition of Indian titles, made by an authorised agent, with the apparent sanction of a late administration of the General Government.</p><p>In view of the premises, the committee recommend the adoption of the following resolution, viz:</p><p><i>Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of Georgia, in General As embly met,</i> That they approve the policy of the General Government towards the Indians, so far as it is calculated to induce them to remove beyond the operation of those causes which evidently tend to retard their improvement, and to extend to them, in a favorable position, the fostering protection and assistance of the country.</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That copies of this report and resolution be transmitted to the President of the United States, and to the delegation in Congress from this State.</p><approvaldate>Approved, Dec. 18, 1829.</approvaldate></law>

The Institution appears to have been managed with care, prudence and discretion. The several superintendants have met with the approbation of the several committees appointed particularly to examine the respective departments; and the fidelity, energy and [Illegible Text] manifested by the Inspectors, give good assurance that they have had a single eye to the improvement of the system of punishment, and the improvement of the means to sustain the Institution. With some alteration in the system generally, the repairs of the building and walls, the erection of cells, and other improvements which will suggest themselves to the Inspectors and the Keeper, there is no doubt that the Institution will be able to sustain itself without aid from the government. Such seem the views for which it was established, the change of punishment alike inefficient in itself, and revolting to the feelings of the christian and the philanthropist.Your committee have not thought it necessary to embody, in this report, an extended view of the fiscal concerns of the Institution.
