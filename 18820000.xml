A. Wright and Treasurer D. N. Speer, submit the following report:</p><p>The undersigned, constituting the sub-committee from the joint standing Committee on Finance, have examined the accounts, vouchers and books of the Comptroller-General and Treasurer, as required by section 186 of the Code, and respectfully submit that the books of these officers are models of neatness and accuracy, and that their reports made are confirmed by the facts and records of their offices.</p><p>The books of the Treasurer, on the 5th day of September, 1881, the day when our predecessors examined into the affairs of that office, showed on hand, at the close of the day, $783,472.57, and said amount corresponds with the books of the Comptroller-General's office. From that date your committee examined the accounts, vouchers, etc., in the office of both the Treasurer and Comptroller-General up to and including the 6th day of September, inst., and the balance on hand at the close of that day's business, as shown by the books of the Treasurer and the facts of the case, was $699,419.47. Your committee verified the truth of the balance shown by the books by actually counting the cash in the vault and examining the statements of the different State depositories as to the balance on hand with them, respectively, an itemized account of which is hereto appended. In this balance is estimated the sum due from two of the State depositories that have failed, to-wit: $82,218.51 due from the Citizens' Bank, of Atlanta, and $22,206.23 due from the Bank of Rome; and to avoid carrying these amounts on the books and in the public reports as cash, we recommend that said sums be charged off the books of the Comptroller and Treasurer, and when any portion or all of the sum shall be realized, that it be receipted for and charged as other revenue finding its way into the treasury, and that a joint resolution be passed authorizing and directing it. We find a splendid vault in the Treasurer's office, amply large and secure for the State's treasure. In the opinion of your committee, the Treasurer and Comptroller deserve the gratitude of the people of this Commonwealth for the accurate, plain, systematic method in which they keep the business of their offices. In a moment's time the condition of any matter can be ascertained, and with the one a check upon the other, the most perfect harmony prevails in matters of fact and figures. We also append statement showing the receipts and expenditures by
