resolution of the legislature of the state of Ohio, on the subject of the abolition of slavery, having had the same under consideration, ask leave to Report:</p><p>That the constitutional guaranty made to the states holding slaves is not less sacred than the obligation imposed upon the constitution and laws for the protection of the rights of private property. Such states owe it to themselves to preserve unimpaired those rights, since the causes which extracted the constitutional concession on this subject, continue to exist in all their force. Your committee are therefore constrained to view the resolution of the legislature of the state of Ohio as calculated to infringe the rights of the state of Georgia, in common with other states similarly situated in this particular, and as indelicate in those from whom it [Illegible Text]. If the evil of slavery be considered a national one, your committee take leave to refer the legislature of Ohio to the situation of the country as it was originally settled in the south by our ancestors; and to those circumstances by the force of which slavery in America commenced its existence.</p><p>While your committee contemplate with no ordinary emotions the ameliorated condition of the slave in the southern country, they view with regret this unnecessary interference on the part of a sister state, so well calculated to excite the anticipations and hopes of the slave, and impel him to those acts, which, instead of bettering his condition, must augment his misfortunes. Your committee therefore consider the resolution as violative of the true dictates of humanityand this idea is supported by a contrast of the slave population of the south with the wretched and miserable condition of the free people of color who crowd the houses of punishment and correction in some of our sister states. If in the south they do not revel in liberty, they are at least supplied with the necessary wants of life.</p><p>Georgia claims the right with her southern sisters, whose situation in this regard is similar, of moving this question when an enlarged system of benevolent and philaothropic exertions in consistency with her rights and interest shall render it practicable.</p><p>Your committee take leave therefore to recommend the following resolution:</p>

Referring to the proceedings which were commenced and are now progressing to a final decision in the supreme court of the United States, the committee find that when a libel was filed by Madrazo, a Spanish subject, in the district court of the United States, William Bowen interposed a claim to the Africans in question according to the practice of admiralty courts. That from the decision of that court and from the

<page id="GA1824.1.P173" no="GA1824.1.174" />

decision of the circuit court Mr. Bowen appealed to the supreme court of the United States, where the case is now pending and will be decided, which decision whether favorable or adverse to the claims of Mr. Bowen, will be final and conclusive.</p><p>Your committee are also of opinion that if the decision of the supreme court should be unfavorable to the claims of the state, good policy and a regard [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] will require that she should acquiesce in that decision and give up the Africans to whomsoever they shall appear to belong, even if the state could not be coerced into acquiescence by the strong arm of the law. The state therefore in the opinion of your committee is bound to preserve and protect the property in litigation, in order that she may when the rights of the parties shall have been decided upon, either [Illegible Text] herself of a favorable decision, or be prepared in a different event to [Illegible Text] the course dictated by policy and justice. To enable her to meet either result she is bound to protect the property and preserve it from any attempt to wrest it from her.</p><p>Your committee taking into their consideration the difficulties which have heretofore attended this business, would gladly recommend such a course for the future as would relieve the state from further embarrassment, but the committee are unable under existing circumstances to devise such a course.</p><p>Your committee have also had under consideration the petition of Mr. Bowen which has been referred to them, in which he proposes to have the property in litigation given up to him upon his giving security to indemnify the state against the claims of all other persons. Your committee are of opinion that this proposition should not be acceded to, because they believe it would be impolitic and unjust. Good policy and a proper regard for the requirements of justice demand of the state that whenever she makes a voluntary surrender of the Africans it should be made to those who shall have established a just and legal claim to them. Putting out of view the mode and manner in which the Africans were brought within the jurisdictional limits of the United States, and giving to Mr. Bowen the full benefit of the argument which he presents, growing out of the want of intention on his part to violate the laws of his country, the committee are satisfied that the facts

attending the transit of the Africans from Amelia island to the Creek Agency were such as authorised their [Illegible Text] and detention. The consequence of this detention has been that persons setting up a claim to the property, and who were disposed to contest the rights of those under whom Mr. Bowen claims title have [Illegible Text] an opportunity of presenting their claims before the proper tribunal. So far as these claims have been investigated the committee are of opinion that great doubts have been cast upon the justice of Mr. Bowen's claims. Leaving the question however to be decided by that tribunal to which it has been carried and to which it properly belongs, your committee are decidedly of opinion that respect for herself and a proper regard for the dictates of justice require of the state that she should preserve and protect the property until that decision shall have been made and when the property is surrendered, let it be to those whose claim shall have been satisfactorily established before the competent tribunal.</p><p>Your committee therefore recommend the adoption of the following resolutions.</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That the legislature approve the course pursued by his excellency the governor in relation to the Africans in possession of the state amidst the difficulties resulting from conflicting claims to the property, prosecuted in different courts, having or pretending to have concurrent jurisdiction.</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That this legislature are of opinion that his excellency the governor will be warranted in pursuing such a course of conduct in future for the security and protection of said property, as his wisdom and prudence may suggest until the title thereto shall have been finally decided upon.</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That his excellency the governor be and he is hereby authorised and requested to employ counsel to defend the rights of this state before the supreme court in the cases there pending in relation to the Africans now in possession of the state.</p><approvaldate>Approved, Dec. 20, 1824.</approvaldate></law>
