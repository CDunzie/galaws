counties of this State, filed in the office of the Comptroller-General, and to compare said digests for the purpose of ascertaining whether the tax valuation of the various classes of property as made in the respective counties of the State, is reasonably uniform as between the respective counties.

The State Tax Commissioner shall name an arbitrator on behalf of the State within three days from the receipt of such demand for arbitration and the two thus named shall select a third within ten days and if they fail to agree upon a third arbitrator within that time, he shall be named and appointed by the Comptroller-General.
