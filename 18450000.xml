Any criminal cause may be carried up to the Supreme Court on a Bill of Exceptions, in writing, specifying the error or errors of law complained of, to be drawn up by the party, his counsel or attorney, within four days after the trial of the cause in which the decision or sentence has been had, and be submitted to the Judge of the Superior Court before whom such criminal cause may have been tried, to be by him certified and signed. Any cause of a civil nature, either on the Law or Equity side of the Superior Court, may in like manner, be carried to the Supreme Court, on a Bill of Exceptions, specifying the error or errors complained of in any decision or judgment, to be drawn up by the party complaining thereof, his counsel, solicitor or attorney, within the time aforesaid, and submitted to the Judge before whom the cause may have been heard, to be by him certified and signed: but in no case shall the facts be controverted in the Supreme Court so as to require attendance of any witness, or witnesses, under any pretence whatever. Said Supreme Court shall hear and determine upon matters contained in the transcript of the record of the cause, and not otherwise. Upon exhibition of any such bill of exceptions to the Judge of the Superior Court, it shall be his duty, if such bill of exceptions be true and consistent with what has transpired in the cause before him, to certify and sign the same. Such bill of exceptions shall operate as a supersedeas to the judgment, sentence, execution, or decree of the Court below, in all cases where bond may be given, or affidavit filed, as hereinafter provided. If in civil cases, either in law or equity, the party complaining of error shall, within four days after the term at which the exceptions were taken, pay all costs which may have accrued, and either personally, or by his agent, solicitor, or attorney in fact or at law, give bond with security to be approved of by the Clerk of the Superior Court, and conditioned to pay the eventual condemnation money, and all subsequent costs; and if in a criminal case, where the offence is by law bailable, the party complaining of error shall enter into recognizance with security to be in like manner approved, conditioned for the appearance in person of such party, complaining, to abide the final order, judgment, or sentence of said Court;

and if the offence be not bailable, or if the party be sentenced to imprisonment in the Penitentiary, and be unable to give security as required, the Judge of the Superior Court may order a supersedeas at the time of certifying and signing the Bill of Exceptions. When such bill of exceptions shall have been signed and certified by the Judge of the Superior Court, and such bond with security shall have been given, or recognizance with security entered into, and costs paid, notice of the signing of such bill of exceptions shall be given, if in a criminal cause, to the Attorney or Solicitor General, and in civil causes in law or equity, to the adverse party, or his counsel, within ten days after the same shall have been done, and shall be filed in the Clerk's office where such bond or recognizance has been given, immediately thereafter, and on a copy of such notice being served by a sheriff, constable, or attorney of the Superior Court, and filed in the clerk's office with the bill of exceptions, it shall be the duty of the Clerk of the Superior Court below to certify and send up to the Supreme Court a complete transcript of the entire record of the cause below, duly certified under his hand and seal of office, and also the bill of exceptions, within ten days after he shall have received the original notice, with the return of service thereon.</p><p>SEC. 5. <i>And be it further enacted,</i> That the Supreme Court shall proceed at the first term (unless prevented by providential cause,) to hear and determine each and every cause which may in manner aforesaid, be sent up from the Court below, upon the record and bill of exceptions, on the ground therein specified, and on no other grounds. Upon the decision of said Supreme Court on matters of Law, or principles of Equity, which may, arise in the bill of exceptions, (which decisions shall always be in writing, and be delivered by the Judges of the said Court <i>seriatim,</i> except in cases where they are unanimous,) the Court shall cause to be certified to the Court below, such decision, and award such order and direction in the premises as may be consistent with the law, and justice of the case; which decision, so rendered and ordered, and direction so awarded, shall be respected and carried into full effect by the Court below. If the decision and judgment of the Court below be for any sum certain, and be affirmed in the Supreme Court, the plaintiff may in the Superior Court enter judgment against the defendant and his securities for the amount of principal, interest, and costs, as shall have been confessed or found by a Jury, and ten per cent. damages on the principal sum, and have execution immediately after the decision of the Supreme Court, so certified as aforesaid. <i>Provided,</i> That if any one or more of the Judges of the Supreme Court shall certify that in his or their opinion such cause was not taken up for delay only, then and in such case, the damages shall not be allowed. Judgments in the Court below, if affirmed, shall not lose any lien or priority by reason of the proceedings in the Court above.</p><p>SEC. 6. <i>And be it further enacted,</i> That if any Judge of

the Superior Court shall refuse to certify a bill of exceptions, when properly tendered, or if any Clerk shall fail or refuse to send up the transcript of the whole record in any cause, according to the provisions of this Act, or he, or any Sheriff shall refuse or neglect to perform any duties imposed upon him by this Act, said Supreme Court, while in session in any District in this State, may issue a writ of mandamus to such officer, and enforce obedience thereto, if necessary, by attachment; and in case that such refusal by any such officer have delayed the party applying for, or tendering a bill of exceptions as aforesaid, beyond the time limited in the foregoing part of this Act, he shall not thereby lose his remedy, but may proceed as if the time limited had not expired.</p><p>SEC. 7. <i>And be it further enacted,</i> That the Sheriff of the county wherein the Supreme Court is holden, or his Deputy, shall attend the sessions thereof, and obey all lawful orders, enforce all lawful commands, and execute all lawful processes of said Court.

The amount of said salary shall not be increased or diminished during the continuance of such Judge of the Supreme Court in office; and no Judge shall receive any other perquisite, reward or compensation, than the amount of his salary. Each and every Judge of the Supreme Court shall, before the Governor of the State, and prior to his receiving his commission, take the oath to support the Constitution, and other oaths now by law required of the Judicial officers of this State.</p><p>SEC. 9. <i>And be it further enacted,</i> That the said Supreme Court shall appoint some fit and proper person as Clerk thereof, who shall hold his appointment for six years, unless removed by said Court upon complaint made, and cause shown for incapacity, improper conduct, or neglect of duty. Said Clerk shall keep an office at the Seat of Government, in one of the departments of the Capitol, where all books, records and archives, and the Seal of the said Court, shall remain. He shall attend all the sessions of said Court, and obey all lawful orders thereof. He shall keep in substantial bound books, fair and regular minutes of the proceedings of said Court, a record of all its Judicial acts, a Docket of its causes, and such other books as said Court may from time to time order and direct. He shall certify, when required, upon payment of his fees, all proceedings of the said Court in the manner now in use in the Superior Courts of this State. And the Record and Minutes of said Supreme Court, and copies thereof, shall be evidence in the same manner and under the same circumstances, as those of the Superior Courts now are; said Supreme Court being to all intents and

purposes a Court of Record. The said Clerk shall be authorized to appoint a deputy or deputies, in his discretion, he being responsible for the faithful performance of their duties.</p><p>SEC. 10. <i>And be it further enacted,</i> That if during the pendency of any cause in the Supreme Court, the security taken on the removal of said cause to the Supreme Court shall become insufficient or inadequate, by reason of removal from the State, insolvency, or otherwise, it shall be the duty of the Court so certifying said cause, on application on oath setting forth the facts showing the inadequacy of said security, from insolvency or otherwise, to require additional and other security, unless the appellant shall make an affidavit under the seventeenth section of this Act, and if the appellant shall fail or refuse to give such additional security, or make and file such affidavit, the Court below shall certify this fact to the Supreme Court, whereupon said suit shall be dismissed at the appellant's costs, and the Judgment in the Court below shall be [Illegible Text] with costs.</p><p>SEC. 11. <i>And be it further enacted,</i> That the said Clerk shall be entitled to the same fees as Clerks of the Superior Courts in this State, to be taxed as part of the costs, and for which the Attorney of Record shall always be bound.</p><p>SEC. 12. <i>And be it further enacted,</i> That some fit and proper person shall be elected by the Judges of said Court as Reporter, who shall hold his office during the term of six years, unless sooner removed by the Court, and shall receive for his services, a salary from the State of one thousand dollars per annum. Said Reporter shall attend all the sessions of said Court, and report, in a proper and professional manner, all the decisions there made, with the reasons therefor, and he shall not, during his service as Reporter, appear as counsel, or act as attorney in any case in any Court in this State.
