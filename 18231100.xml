This [Illegible Text] was not gratuitous on the part of the government of the Union, but was in consideration of the surrender, by the state of Georgia, of a territory sufficiently valuable and extensive to constitute two independent and powerful members of the federal compact. The motive to this surrender cannot be misunderstood. In consenting thus to restrict her right of soil and her sovereignty, Georgia looked with the confidence which she has always reposed in the plighted faith of the Union, to the prompt extinguishment of the Indian title to all the land within her remaining limits, and the speedy settlement of her then, and still vacant territory. Limiting her ultimate views of extensive empire, she had hoped by such limitation to escape from the helplessness of a protracted infancy, and marching in quick time to the accomplishment of her destinies, to have seen her laws and her sovereignty co-extensive with the limits of the territory within which she had consented to confine herself. Twenty-one years have passed away, and she is still destined to experience the disappointment of her hopes. She has witnessed during this period the extension of the Unionthe multiplication of the members of the federal republic, by repeated acquisitions of territory, while she is doomed to have a long line of frontier exposed to the predatory incursions of the savage, and the lives of her citizens who dwell there, to his subtle and relentless vengeance.</p><p>Such, Sir, is her claim to relief. It seems to these [Illegible Text] morialists, that it is too obvious to require farther exposition. Do the United States possess the power to afford it? That the state of Georgia is vested with the ultimate title to all the lands within her territorial limitsthat the claim of the Indians is consequently restricted to a mere temporary usufructuary right, are propositions which it is believed can neither be doubted nor denied. The existing state of things must therefore have a termination. The time must come when the soil of Georgia shall no longer be imprinted with the footstep of the savagewhen the inhabitants of her border shall no longer [Illegible Text] liable to be awakened from their slumbers by the war whoop of an approaching foe, nor to witness the destruction of their dwellings in the blaze which illumines his retreatwhen her sovereignty

shall be co-extensive with her territory, and the authority and the protection of her laws, shall [Illegible Text] every portion of her empire. Such a state of things must come. It must be produced, too, by the act, and at the expense of the government of the Union, in the fulfilment of her obligation to Georgia. Will delay facilitate its ultimate accomplishment? Will it lessen the expense to be incurred by the United States? Is it required by any rational consideration of humanity towards the Indians tribes who now roam through the wilderuess of our state? It seems to these memorialists that delay can only serve to multiply [Illegible Text] to the fulfilment of the engagements of the Union. From [Illegible Text] too obvious to require detail, every day diminishes the disposition of the savage to abandon his accustomed haunts, and consequently increases the price which he will demand for their surrender. No principle of humanity forbids the enforcement of the claim. The exhausted state of the game affords a scanty and precurious subsistence to the hunter, and a dispersed and wandering population are not in a condition to become the objects of the benefits of civilization. Their removal beyond the Mississippi, would give to those sons of nature a wilderness congenial to their feelings and appropriate to their wants, while the region which they would relinquish, would become the [Illegible Text] of civilization, and contribute to the happiness of thousands.</p><p>These memorialists have seen with what facility the United States, blending justice with authority, have been [Illegible Text] to prescribe to the native tribes inhabiting the [Illegible Text] territory of Florida, the limits of their range, and they do not doubt that a similar exercise of a legitimate [Illegible Text], equally tempered by justice, will suffice to obtain for Georgia all which she desires. They ask, therefore, from the government of the Union, certainly with the respect which they have always felt, and which they have [Illegible Text] no proper occasion to manifest to the government of their choice, and of their confidence, but at the same time with the earnestness which is authorised by the justice of their claim, and demanded by the necessities of their constituents, that a liberal appropriation may be made for the [Illegible Text] of the Indian title to all the remaining lands within the limits of Georgia, and that commissioners

To them it seems, that the obvious intention of these parties was, to invest him with

<page id="GA1823.1.P239" no="GA1823.1.241" />

authority to examine and decide each individual claim with reference to the proof aduced in support of it. The controversy between the commissioners of Georgia, and the chiefs, warriors, and head men of the Creek nation, regarded the proof of the claims, a list of which was exhibited, and not the question whether those claims, if proved, should be allowed. This inference, as the memorialists believe, may be deduced from the terms of the articles of agreement, as well as from a consideration of the relative character of the reference. But it will prevent repetition, and present a condensed view of the subject, to consider it with reference to the rule of decision complained of.</p><p>That rule excludes all claims originating in the depredations committed (by the Indians on the citizens of Georgia,) in a period of hostilities, or previous thereto, if not provided for in the treaty, which followed such hostilities. It purports to be founded on the principle adopted among civilized nations, that a treaty merges all pre-existing claims, and that those not provided for, are consequently annulled. In its application to the case under consideration, it has the effect of excluding all claims previous to the treaty of New York, (seventeen hundred and ninety,) except for slaves: and all claims originating subsequently thereto and prior to the treaty of Colerain, (seventeen hundred and ninety-six,) except for the property provided to be given up by that treaty. It is [Illegible Text] contended that this rule is inapplicable to the claims of the citizens of Georgia on any just principle of [Illegible Text]that it is forbidden by the terms of the agreement entered into at the Indian Springs, and the relinquishment consequent thereto, and is repelled by the circumstances [Illegible Text] that negociation.</p><p>No just principle of analogy, it is conceived, will authorise the application of the rules which govern [Illegible Text] between independent and civilized nations, to the negociations terminating in compact, between the United States, or the state of Georgia, and the Indians, residing within the territorial limits of the [Illegible Text]. If, on the one hand, [Illegible Text] be admitted that these Indians are, to a certain degree independent, and that their independence is recognised by the act of treating with them, it seems clear, on the [Illegible Text], that

<page id="GA1823.1.P240" no="GA1823.1.242" />

this independence has its [Illegible Text] They are locally resident within [Illegible Text] territorial limits of Georgia; and it is difficult to conceive the idea of a nation absolutely independent, and yet resident within the limits of another independent state. The question may be tested thus[Illegible Text] independence [Illegible Text] uncontrolled sovereignty, and incluses the idea of the right of alienating the national domain, at the will of the nation, and to a purchaser of its choice. Could the state of Georgiawould the United States submit to the uncontrolled exercise of this rightto its exercise in favor of any foreign nation, by any nation of Indians dwelling within their territorial limits? If this question be, as it is believed it must be, answered in the negative, it seems vain to contend, that the Creek Indians, constitute an independent nation, since the concession strips them of one of the attributes of independence.</p><p>But if independent, they are uncivilized, and would, from this consideration, have a just claim to be relieved from rules adopted by civilized nations in the construction of treaties, if those rules were injurious to them in their operation. They cannot, therefore, demand the benefit of them, [Illegible Text] set up an implied exemption, contravening the otherwise plain import of their express stipulations. An Indian treaty is, it is conceived, an instrument which is to be construed according to its literal import, or at most, according to its meaning and intent, as these may be collected from the instrument itself, the circumstances attendant on its execution, and the character of its framers; but it cannot it is believed, be properly subjected to the artificial, technical rules, which prevail between civilized nationsrules, the existence of which, was unknown to the savage negociator, by which he would not have consented that his nation should be bound, and of which he has therefore no just claim to demand the benefit.</p><p>If it could be conceded that the principle contended for, was generally applicable to treaties with the Indian tribes, even then, in the view of these memorialists, it would be insufficient to support the rule complained of At most it is an <i>implied</i> release, and may be controlled by an <i>opposite</i> and <i>stronger</i> implication, and still more by subsequent <i>express</i> stipulation. If the several treaties, from that of New York to that of Colerain, operated in terms of the

<page id="GA1823.1.P241" no="GA1823.1.243" />

rule, to annual all claims not provided for by them, so as to exclude them by implication from the treaty of the Indian Springs, those treaties, operating also by force of their own terms, to protect the claims which they had provided for, these were consequently no longer a subject of negociation, except as to the mode of payment. The negociations of the commissioners Georgia, and of the chiefs, warriors, and head men of the Creek nation, were then on that occasion limited to the claims arising posterior to the treaty of Colerain, and prior to the act of Congress of eighteen hundred and two, a period short of six years, the claims during which amounted, according to the list exhibited in the course of the negociation, and surrendered at its close, to a, sum less than seventeen thousand dollars. Can it be believed that such was the view of the negociators on either side?</p><p>Independently of the intrinsic evidence, the agreement furnishes the answer. The reference is not of claims provided, or unprovided for by this or that treaty, but of <i>all</i> claims of <i>whatever</i> nature. If the benefit of the implied release contended for, in behalf of the Indians, be conceded to them, here then is a waiver of ita new assumption of their obligationa reference to the President to liquidate its amount, by deciding on the equity and justice of each individual claim, on an examination of the evidence adduced to support it.</p><p>But the rule in question is extanded to exclude claims to compensation for <i>property destroyed,</i> and a verbal criticism has been resorted to by the United States' commissioners, as a fit mode of interpreting the terms of an agreement entered into by a savage tribe. It is urged, (still confining the claimants to the treaties anterior to that of the Indian Springs, on which last they exclusively rely,) that a stipulation to <i>restore,</i> cannot be applied to that, which has been <i>destroyed</i> and <i>does not exist.</i> The argument in the view of the memorialists, is entitled to a grave consideration, because of the source from which it emanates. As between individuals, an agreement to deliver or to restore a specified article, impliedly includes the alternative of accounting for its value, or of making compensation in damages, if the express obligation [Illegible Text] not fulfilled. What should exempt

<page id="GA1823.1.P242" no="GA1823.1.244" />

a nation from the operation of this rule? If Great Britain had stipulated to restore (instead of making compensation for) the negroes plundered on our sea board during the late [Illegible Text] would her incapacity to make specific restoration of those who had escaped from her possession, or been removed by death, have absolved her from the obligation to restore their value? Did she not in fact agree to make restoration in value, without regard to these considerations? But an instance more immediately appropriate to the subject may be drawn from the treaty of Augusta. The Indians thereby stipulate that <i>all</i> negroes, horses, cattle, or other property, taken during the late war, shall be restored. The obligation applies to <i>all negroes, c. c. taken during the war,</i> and would not be released by the incapacity of the contracting party to restore them <i>specifically.</i> Upon proof that they had been <i>so taken,</i> the right of the citizen of Georgia, would, it is apprehended, be complete either to specific restoration, or to restoration in value. But, dismissing the consideration of this verbal argument, it may be, and it is respectfully enquired, if there is not something in the distinctive characters of civilized and of savage warfare, which strengthens, in the latter case, the claim to compensation for property destroyed. In wars between civilized nations, the destruction of property is used only as a means to an end in the exercise of force for the attainment of the object of the war. The savage, on the other hand, wars for plunderdestroying what he cannot remove. Is it meet that we should encourage this predatory warfare, by extending to it the protective regulations of civilized strife?</p><p>But the claim to property destroyed in the case under consideration, is derived from the agreement, the treaty, and the deed of relinquishment, all executed at the Indian Springs. The agreement refers to the decision of the President, <i>all claims of whatever nature or kind.</i> The treaty stipulates that the commissioners of Georgia, shall relinquish all claims for property taken or destroyed prior to the act of eighteen hundred and two. A list of claims was exhibited at the Indian Springs, including those for property destroyed, and property unprovided for, by either of the preceding treaties, <i>on which</i> the commissioners of Georgia were required to execute, and did in [Illegible Text] execute,

<page id="GA1823.1.P243" no="GA1823.1.245" />

the relinquishment stipulated for by the treaty at the Indian Springs. Why, it may be asked, were the terms of the reference so large, if its objects were so limited? Why were the commissioners of Georgia required to relinquish that to which the citizens of Georgia had no claimto release the Indians from claims, from which they were already absolved according to the rule contended for, by force of preceding treaties?</p><p>The argument for which we contend, is further supported by a reference to the circumstances attending the negociation at the Indian Springs. The claims of the citizens of Georgia had been registered under the laws of the state. A list prepared by authority of its Executive was furnished to the commissioners of Georgiawas exhibited by them, as a particular of their demand, and was surrendered, as an evidence of what was released to the Indian chiefs at the close of [Illegible Text] negociation. It amounted to a sum which may be stated in round numbers at two hundred and eighty thousand dollars. For its payment, the Indians provided a fund of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars, in the hands of the United States. Now the application of the rule contended forthat which excludes claims for property destroyed, and property not provided for by previous treaties, would at once have annihilated one half of this claim. The fact will be obvious on a very slight inspection of the list, and must have been manifest to the Indian negociators. Is it conceivable, if they had intended to rely on this rule, as a bar to the claims which it would control, that they would not have ascertained its effect, by applying it to the list of claims exhibited, and have denied their liability for those which it covered;or having ascertained its effect, and that it would reduce the claims of our citizens to a sum not exceeding one hundred and fifty thousand dollars, that they would have left in the hands of the United States a fund of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars, to be applied to this object, without any stipulation for the payment over to themselves, of the large surplus, which must inevitably remain?</p><p>These reflections seem unanswerably to repel the idea, that it was the intention of the contracting parties to exclude the claims under consideration, and it is [Illegible Text] unnecessary

<page id="GA1823.1.P244" no="GA1823.1.246" />

to shew that the President of the United States ought not to apply, since it is not believed he is disposed to apply to the contract of these parties, a rule of interpretation which could not have entered into the views of either of them in framing it</p><p>It remains only to add that the agreement to refer to the President of the United States, the immediate representative of the party bound by the terms of the treaty, to pay what should be awarded, the decision of the question, how much should be paid, was made in the fulness of the confidence, which the people of Georgia have ever felt, and still feel, in the present chief magistrate of the Union. In the same spirit, and with the most entire confidence in the justice of the individual to whom this appeal is made, a review of that decision is now solicited. It is believed, by the memorialists, that the claims of the citizens of Georgia which were exhibited by her commissioners at the treaty of the Indian Springs, whether prov ded, or [Illegible Text] for by previous treaties, are protected by that treaty; and on proof of them individually, that they are enitled to allowance and payment out of the unappropriated fund, in the hands of the United States:and it is respectfully requested that the decision of this question maybe referred to the commissioners of the United States and of Georgia who negociated that treaty, or that such other mode may be adopted as, in the view of the President, shall be consistent with the just rights of the claimants.</p><approvaldate>Approved, Dec. 22, 1823.</approvaldate></law></part>
