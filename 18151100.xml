they trust, the propriety of completing the building as it at present stands, for the speedy reception of criminals. With respect to the completion of the original plan, the committee beg leave to state, that even if that plan were not as good as might have been devised, yet many disadvantages must necessarily result from leaving it unfinished. One wing was intended for female criminals; will not many difficulties arise if the plan be abandoned? It is urged by many that it is too extensivebut this is bare conjecture, and the Legislature who approved the plan, did not coincide with those who entertain this opinionIf there be any difference of sentement on this point, will it not be more prudent to have the building too large, rather than risque its being too small; what would be the consequence if more criminals should arrive than could be received? How could the sentence of the law be carried into effect? The committee are nevertheless sensible, that economy ought to be consulted; but if they were to hazard an opinion, they would assert, that the public good is more frequently sacrificed by economising, than by a prodigal use of the public money. They are of opinion that the Penitiary can be completed with as little expence to the state at this, as well as at any subsequent period; there are materials on hand which must otherwise be sold, and there is a sufficient number of workmen ready to undertake; they therefore beg leave to submit the following resolution:</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That the wing and centre of that part of the [Illegible Text] already erected, be prepared as speedily as possible, for the reception of criminals; that the contemplated wall be so constructed as to strike the same point as if the building were complete, and thence take such a direction as not to interfere with carrying on the original plan, which is recommended to be pursued as soon as convenient; and that the sum of twenty five thousand dollars be appropriated for the purposes aforesaid.</p><approvaldate>Approved, 16th December, 1815.</approvaldate></law><law id="R1815V1N110" initial.page="122"><shorttitle><i>In Senate,</i> 12th December, 1815.</shorttitle><p>On motion or Mr. Charlton;</p><p>The late war with Great Britain being closed by an [Illegible Text] peace, imposes upon the Legislature of this
