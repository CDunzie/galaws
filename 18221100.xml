<page id="GA1822.1.P149" no="GA1822.1.150" />

<p>Your committee are duly impressed with the interesting nature of the subject which has been referred to them, and have given that consideration which their time and opportunities would allow. They regard it as being in close connection with the interest of our citizens, with the finances and improvement of our state, and with her character and influence as a member of the Federal Union. The extension of our limits produces no unfavorable influence upon the strength or compactness of our organization. On the contrary, the purchases which have been made since eighteen hundred and seventeen, are inhabited by a population enterprising and respectable in peace, and who would form a confident reliance in times of war. An extension to our final limits your committee consider an object much to be desired: until this object is attained, a permanent and uniform course of legislation cannot be well pursued, and general schemes of internal improvement and public education must be measurably [Illegible Text] In the older sections of the state, the population is already as dense as agricultural convenience and interest will well admit.</p><p>The increasing exports of the State evince her advancement in commercial importance, for the greater encouragement of this productive industry. Your committee consider it important that new territory should be subjected to its operations. That new resources should be given to our different seaport towns by an extensive back country, newly acquired.</p><p>Your committee are of opinion that the difficulties of extinguishing the Indian title will increase [Illegible Text] by delay. The tribes upon our borders at one period evinced a spirit of emigration; this is subsiding, but possibly coud be again excited. The Seminole tribe are lible to be sent above the Florida line, within the present Creek boundary, some intercourse with the white settlements is unavoidable. Such intercourse with the tribe would be particularly annoying to the citizens of Georgia, against whom they encourage a decided hostility.</p><p>Your committee recommend the following resolutions.</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That his excellency the Governor continue his exertions in furtherance of the objects of this report, and that he forward a copy thereof to the President of the United States, and to each of our Senators and Representatives in Congress.</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That our Senators in Congress be instructed, and our Representatives requested to use their efforts and influence in [Illegible Text] suitable appropriations for holding treaties with the nations of Indians within the limits of Georgia, and that they aid the objects of the foregoing report in such manner as they may consider best calculated to carry them into effect.</p><p><i>Resolved further,</i> That this house highly approve the conduct and [Illegible Text] of the Senaters and Representatives of this state in Congress previous to this time, [Illegible Text] relation to the subject of this report.</p>
