It has been the unfortunate lot of our state, to be embroiled in the question of territorial right, almost from the commencement of her existence. The feelings excited by such warmth and succession of contest, have been hightened and aggravated by inconveniences and exposures incident to our frontier situation. To alleviate this conditionto circumscribe our extent of settlement and become more defensible; and finally, to settle the questions of <i>territory,</i> limits and boundaries, were the prevailing inducements to the vast relinquishment made by Georgia to the United States in the articles of agreement and cession of 1802. Abstractedly from these inducements, it will not be contended that other considerations could have produced the effect.The period has now arrived, when in the opinion of your memorialists, the subject is no longer to be regulated by the rules of policy and convenience, but has assumed the more definite and substantial shape of positive right. It has long been the desire of Georgia, that her settlements should be extended to her ultimate limitsthat the soil within her boundaries should be subjected to her control, and that her police, organization and government should be fixed and permanent. For the fulfilment of these desires, we have waited the tide of events.

<page id="GA1819.1.P153" no="GA1819.1.154" />

and observed the march of time for seventeen years.Within this period, we have witnessed with much gratification the spread of the Union, and the accession of states and territories, greater in extent than the original confederation. Two of the members of this vast family are the descendants of Georgia, yet Georgia loses her strength and influence as a member of the Republic, retarded as she is, in her growth and population, and denied the fostering aid of her common parent.</p><p>The stipulation contained in the articles of agreement and cession of 1802, is the principal point to which your memorialists would invite your attention. This contract, from the time it was entered into, has been subject to be performed whenever the same could be done on peaceable and reasonable terms. By the treaty of Fort Jackson, an opportunity was presented to the United States, of performing her contract with us, and also to have acquired for herself any extent of territory which she might have thought proper to dictate. It is now ascertained that Georgia obtains by that treaty a tract of country scarcely sufficient to invite our attention thither, or to authorize the process of organization. This treaty having heretofore been made the subject of communication to your Excellency, in which the people of Georgia have expressed their opinions and feelings, it only remains for us again to adopt the like sentiments, and repeat our protest and remonstrance against said treaty, so far as it relates to the extinguishment of Indian title within the limits of Georgia.</p><p>In 1817, Commissioners acting under the authority of the United States, treated with the Cherokee Nation [Illegible Text] Indians, some of whom resided within our limits. By this treaty, the interests of Georgia were more regarded, and we believe a plan laid which would have resulted in the speedy extinction of the Indian claim within our limits, and upon terms not only peaceable and reasonable, but convenient and beneficial to the Union. It was already ascertained, that a considerable portion of the Indians had emigrated beyond the Mississippi, and

<page id="GA1819.1.P154" no="GA1819.1.155" />

excepted land in exchange for that which they had abandoned. The state of Georgia claims a right to the jurisdiction and soil of the territory within her limits. She admits however that the right is <i>inchoate,</i> remaining to be perfected by the United States in the extinction of the Indian title; the United States, <i>pro [Illegible Text] vice,</i> acting as our agents. The signing of this treaty by authorized agents, and the after [Illegible Text] confirmed our title. The cession made by the first article is acknowledged to be absolute in conveying for the use of Georgia, the territory which it defines. Tennessee acquires the like title by the second article, and both states acquire a further vested interest in the [Illegible Text] lands within their respective boundaries, [Illegible Text] in extent to the number of natives that had or was about to emigrate. The provisions of this treaty were accepted on the part of Georgia; and on such acceptance your memorialists humbly conceive, that her title and her possession were so strongly vested, that without her consent she could not be affected by subsequent negotiation. If a census of the nation had been taken in 1818, in conformity to the provisions of the treaty, Georgia would have come into the immediate and uninterrupted possession of at least one third of that part of her territory originally occupied by Cherokees. How we can be defeated of the interest, and divested of the title which resulted from the treaty, becomes a point of enquiry and of feeling importance.</p><p>Your memorialists acknowledge the legality of no measure which seeks thus to defeat or divest them. On the contrary, they insist upon the validity and execution of that contract in all instances in which it conveys a benefit.But on the face of <i>this</i> treaty is contained a feature, against which your memorialists <i>remonstrate</i> and <i>protest.</i> The grant of reserves in <i>fee simple</i> to Indians is an act, which your memorialists view as not only violatory of the compact between the United States and Georgia, but an infringement of our rights, and an exposure of our citizens. To the grant of fee simple title we attach technical definition. One of the consequences

<page id="GA1819.1.P155" no="GA1819.1.156" />

of such grant, is power of alienation. Then in the event of alienation by the reserve, where is the power of the United States to extinguish for the use of Georgia the title to such reserve?</p><p>Your memorialists beg leave further to call in question the articles of convention between the United States and the Cherokee Nation of Indians, concluded on the 27th February, 1819. We consider these articles as furnishing a fair subject for the animadversion of Georgia.They profess to nullify in a great degree the provisions of the treaty of 1817, and to set up their own provisions as substituted therefor. As objectionable as the original was, this substitute is the more so. If the grant of reserves in the first, furnished grounds of complaint, those in the last are much more offensive; for the possibility of reversion is not retained. Shall we be told that all these measures find their justification in policy, and their apology in benevolence? Shall this treaty be passed upon us in the imposing form of humanity, and we compelled to subserve its views, and pay blind obedience to its commands? We trust that we may be heard; and that if in uttering our complaints we shall speak with an unbecoming boldness, our excuse may be found in the extended catalogue of Indian aggression, and the aggravated series of frontier suffering.</p><p>This last treaty purports to be founded upon a sufficient consideration, to amount to a fair equivalent for the interest relinquished. This may be true, and still injustice done. If upon the ratification of the first treaty, no interest had vested in Georgia, or if no party had been connected with the contract except the United States and the Cherokees, it might be granted that the same parties had a right to revise, alter or even set aside such contract. But situated as we are, we claim to have been benefited, by a positive, vested interest, and we complain of the attempt to defeat that interest by the second treaty. The consideration of this treaty, is in fact paid by the state of Georiga, and yet she does not receive a fair equivalent. A territory is secured, inconsiderable in point

<page id="GA1819.1.P156" no="GA1819.1.157" />

of extent, <i>more</i> inconsiderable in point of value, and still more inconsiderable by reason of being mutilated and crippled by the grant of reserves. By this same treaty, the United States acquired for Tennessee, a tract of country great in extent, and still greater in value and importance. The growth and prosperity of a sister state, affords gratification to Georgia. We are excited by no jealousies, actuated by no feelings of competition. But when favors are dispensed we hope to see them administered by the steady hand of impartial justice. Such admeasurement would have afforded us a better interest, and been in furtherance of a solemn contract.</p><p>Your memorialists respectfully solicit, that Commissioners acting under the authority of the United States, may treat with the Creek and Cherokee Nations of Indians, for further cessions of territory for the use of Georgia.</p><p>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</p><p>Saturday, 11th Dec. 1819.</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That a copy of this remonstrance be forwarded to the President of the United States, one to the Senate of the United States, one to the House of Representatives, and one to each of the members of Congress from this state.</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That the members of Congress from this state be requested to make use of the necessary exertions for carrying into effect the objects of this remonstrance.</p><approvaldate>Approved, 22d December, 1819.</approvaldate></law><law id="R1819V1N140" initial.page="157"><shorttitle>In the House of Representatives, 30th November, 1819.</shorttitle><p>RESOLVED, That Charles Beall be, and he is hereby appointed a Notary Public for the county of Wilkinson, in the place of Paul M'Cormick, removed.</p><approvaldate>Approved, 14th December, 1819.</approvaldate></law><law id="R1819V1N141" initial.page="157"><shorttitle>In the House of Representatives, 27th November, 1819.</shorttitle><p>The joint committee on the state of the republic, to

of our water courses. We hope, therefore, that the present session of the Legislature will not be suffered to pass by without some attempt being made to call in to our aid the talents and experience of the most enlightened persons on this subject. At the same time, we would remark, that much good appears to have resulted from the efforts of some of our commissioners, and indeed, in a few cases, there appears little to be desired.</p><p>We have experienced much difficulty in forming our opinions on the reports we have received.

More detail on these subjects, and on the subject of expenditure, are very essential in reports of this kind.</p><p>With regard to the Savannah river from Augusta down, we have the pleasure of stating, that an efficient use of machinery appears to have been introduced into their system of operations.

<p>With regard to the survey directed to be made from the Altamaha to Turtle river, we have to remark, that the object intended to be accomplished by this measure appears to us very important. But the survey made does not appear sufficiently accurate to authorize the large appropriation requisite to effect the opening of a canal.And this is the more confirmed as the commissioners appear in doubt whether the Turtle or Sapelo river afford the best destination for such canal. It may also be desirable to receive from individuals proposals for executing this project in consideration of some certain tolls.</p><p>From the Ocmulgee river, we have a report, from which it appears that considerable improvements are going on in that stream.
