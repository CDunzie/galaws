Your committee in again presenting a condensed view of the subject referred to their consideration, will purposely be very brief, as the merits of the question have been so often presensed to the Federal Government, and particularly in the report and resolutions agreed to by the General Assembly of this State, on the sixteenth day of December, eighteen hundred and twenty-eight, which your committee beg may be referred to, as presenting most of the evidences and facts, on which Georgia claims a final settlement of the boundary line between this State and the Territory of Florida.</p>

<page id="GA1830.1.P229" no="GA1830.1.230" />

<p>By referring to the Charter of Georgia, which was granted in the year seventeen hundred and thirty-two, to certain persons, and its surrender to the King of Great Britain, in the year seventeen hundred and fifty-two, by the trustees, and the proclamation of seventeen hundred and sixty-three, establishing the Government of East and West Florida, and extending the Southern boundary of Georgia, and the Commission of Governor Wright, at which time, both Georgia and Florida, were British Colonies or Provinces, dated the twentieth day of January, seventeen hundred and sixty-four, the only legitimate inference from each of the recited evidences, is, that the southern line of Georgia, was to run from the most southern stream of a river St. Mary's, and westward from thence, and consequently leaving the whole of the head waters of that river, within the boundary of Georgia, and every other public document which relates to the said boundary, either as a boundary line of the United States or the State of Georgia, is in palpable accordance with this conclusion, until the year eighteen hundred.</p><p>In the year seventeen hundred and ninety-five, the Governments of the United States and Spain concluded a treaty, by the second article of which, it was agreed that a line should begin from a point at the junction of the Flint and Chattahoochie rivers, and to run from thence to the head of the St. Mary's river. Under the provisions of said treaty, Commissioners were to be appointed to run and plainly mark said line, and Commissioners were accordingly appointed, and in the year, eighteen hundred, Mr. Ellicott, the Commissioner on the part of the United States, and the Commissioner on the part of Spain met, and attempted to run and mark the said line from the junction of the Flint and Chattahoochie rivers, to the head of the St. Mary's, but from causes which it is now necessary to state in detail, the line was not run, but the Commissioners fixed on a spot near a branch of the river St. Mary's, and erected a mound, and agreed that the mound so erected by them, near the Okafanoke swamp, should be taken as the true head of the St. Mary's river, and that a line should be run from the junction of the Flint and Chattahoochie rivers, to said mound, and that it should be taken as the true line: <i>Provided,</i> if said line did not pass within one mile north of said mound, it should be correct to carry it to that distance.</p><p>Your committee after having recited some of the evidences on which Georgia claims that the boundary line between this State and the Territory of Florida, have not been either finally or satisfactorily settled, take leave to state, that until

<page id="GA1830.1.P230" no="GA1830.1.231" />

the year eighteen hundred and nineteen, very little was known of the section of country about the head of the St. Mary's river. The Okefenoke swamp, in which it has its head, anterior to that time, was an almost impenetrable wilderness, and was very little known to civilized man, and that the explorations made by the authority of the Legislature of this State in the year eighteen hundred and eighteen, were not intended to do more than to collect information of a part of the lands and boundary line of Georgia. But since that time the Indian right of occupancy has been extinguished to all of the lands in this State from the junction of the Flint and Chattahoochie rivers, to the head of the St. Mary's river, and that section of this State is now generally settled, and the country generally known. It is therefore now believed that it will not be difficult or uncertain to ascertain the true head of the St. Mary's river. Your committee believe the Legislature will not discharge a duty it owes to the good citizens of this State, without once more asking and requesting the Federal Government to co-operate in this desirable object, and have the said line run and plainly markedYour committee have too much confidence in the authorities of the General Government, to indicate an opinion that the rights of Georgia are not attended to from improper considerations.</p><p>The reports made to Congress by the Judiciary committees, to whom the subject has been referred; one on the twenty-first day of March, eighteen hundred and twenty-eight, and another on the thirtieth day of January, eighteen hundred and thirty, have been carefully examined by your committee, but as the said reports do not contain any new evidence of the claim on which the United States maintain that the mound erected by Mr. Ellicott, to be truly  carefully placed at, or near the head of the St. Mary's river; they have considered it improper at this time to make any examination of the conclusions arrived at, by the arguments relied on in said reports.</p><p>In conclusion your committee are satisfied that it is their duty to state that if the question of the settlement of boundary between Georgia and the Territory of Florida, is not fully and finally settled under the provisions of the resolutions which are attached to this report, no further attempts should be made by this State, in the way now sought to effect the desirable object, but that the question ought to be carried for decision before the proper Judicial Tribunal, and to effect the objects embraced in this report, your committee recommend the adoption of the following resolutions:</p>

Samuel Gillespie. The settlement still is complex  far [Illegible Text] being satisfactory. The commencement of this business was in the year eighteen hundred and sixteen. A company styled commissioners to improve the navigation of the Ocmulgee river, was incorporated by the Legislature of this State. The following year, ten thousand dollars was appropriated for the improvement of said river. In the year eighteen hundred and eighteen, the commissioners purchased ten hands, cost eight thousand dollars, two thousand dollars laid out in flats, working utensils, cloths and provisions; one negro was killed, two runaway, and one died, the balance was sold for three thousand seven hundred and fifty-seven dollars. In eighteen hundred and twenty-two the Legislature made a second appropriation, of ten thousand dollars, to be laid out in able bodied negro fellows, and titles to be vested in the State. How this second appropriation was disbursed, the agent states, it is impossible for him to find out as yet.</p><p>In the year eighteen hundred and twenty-six, an additional sum of twenty thousand dollars was appropriated by the Legislature, for the improvement of the Ocmulgee river below Macon. In eighteen hundred and twenty-eight, thirty-eight negroes were purchased at four hundred and fifty dollars each, amounting to seventeen thousand dollars, as appears by the report of the commissioners to the Legislature in eighteen huedred twenty-nine. The commissioners deeming it advantageous to the State and to the company, to go into the boating business, did so; not getting freight enough, they concluded to enter into the cotton speculation in Macon, and grocery in Savannah. From the fall of cotton, or imprudence in purchasing, or both, they realised a loss instead of a profit. To make good this loss to creditors, they had to raise money from the sale of all of their boats, fourteen of the negroes, and the hire of twenty-seven hands for four or five months.</p><p>The agent further states, that from the best information he can gather of this complex business, that the commissioners have owned in all, fifty two negroes, twenty-nine have been turned over to the superintendant of roads and rivers, two have absconded, seven have died and been drowned, and fourteen they had to sell to pay the debts due at the close of this cotton and grocery speculation. It appears on a final settlement of this business, that the States agents, had to pay debts due by the commissioners of the river below Macon, to the amount of one hundred and seventy-nine dollars and thirty-two cents. He deducted this amount from three hundred and fifty-one dollars cash he received of the river commissions

Your committee believe that where exclusive advantages are extended to an incorpated body, by legislative enactment, to the prevention of individual exertion in the same object, too close a scrutiny into their privileges cannot be instituted; and too much caution cannot be adopted in requiring a strict compliance with the duty voluntarily assumed by the corporationthat as monopolies are always detrimental to private enterprise, in cases where the privileged party are wholly regardless of the obligations assumed, and the public sustain injury, it is injustice to the latter that the monopoly should continue.</p><p>In the case referred to the committee, the Ogeechee river has never been benefitted by the privileges conferred on

this company; and although nearly twenty years have elapsed since their incorporation, yet nothing materially facilitating the navigation of this river, has been done by the association. Your committee conceive that the charter this company has been forfeited, and that the navigation of the river may be more certainly effected, if the power of the existing company be destroyed. They therefore submit and recommend the adoption of the following resolution:</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That his Excellency the Governor, be requested to direct the Attorney General of this State, to institute proceedings in nature of a quo warranto against the president and directors of the Ogeechee navigation company, with the view of rescinding the charter of said company.</p><p>THOMAS STOCKS, President.</p><p>Attest, JOHN A.

The agent states, that he has not attempted to procure a settlement of the appropriation by the Legislature, for improving of the Ocoonee river, prior to the act of eighteen

hundred and twenty-six; by the second section of that act, the commissioners of the Oconee navigation, in whose favor the Legislature, by the acts of the fifteenth of December, eighteen hundred and fifteennineteenth December, eighteen hundred and seventeen, and the twenty-second December, eighteen hundred and twenty-five, appropriated the sum of twenty-three thousand dollars, and whose operations appear from time to time to have been reported to the Legislature, were directed to turn over to the commissioners then appointed, all the property, negroes, implements, c. in their hands belonging to State. The direction contained in this second section of the act, so far as the agent has been able to learn, has been but partially complied with, by the delivery of the negroes, implements, and one hundred shares of Bank stock. For a more detailed account, reference can be had to the report of the committee of the late board, at pages 3567 and 8, of their minutes. The report of the committee does not appear to have been agreed to by the board, nor any further attempts made to procure a settlement. There was doubts in the agents mind, whether the power was vested in him, to investigate this business, prior to the act of the twenty-sixth December, eighteen hundred and twenty-six, appropriating twenty thousand dollars. Therefore, he has confined himself in his settlement with the commissioners appointed by this act. The agent certainly has been active, able, vigilant and industrious, in the investigation and settlement with those commissionersThe following is a condensed view of the settlement.</p><table><tr align="LEFT" valign="TOP"><td>The appropriation 26th Dec. 1826,</td><td align="RIGHT">$20,000 00</td></tr><tr align="LEFT" valign="TOP"><td>100 shares of State Bank Stock,</td><td align="RIGHT">10,000 00</td></tr><tr align="LEFT" valign="TOP"><td>Dividend on Bank Stock,</td><td align="RIGHT">1,050 00</td></tr><tr align="LEFT" valign="TOP"><td>Cash of Col.

The peace of seventeen hundred and eighty-two, found the State of Georgia as also the other States of the confederation, devoid of credit and without any medium for the commerce of the country, but revolutionary and depreciated money. The scarcity of gold and silver (as the act authorizing the issuing of the fifty thousand pounds expresses it) rendered it necessary to supply the good people of this State, with a medium of commerce of a sound and solid nature for want of which, they already suffered; and founded upon these premises, really and truly existing, the Legislature emitted this fifty thousand pounds, with the best intentions, with full confidence of its usefulness, its prop to public credit, and its entire security, from the pledge of a vast tract of valuable land, and the guarantee of the honour and faith of Georgia, superadded to mortgage of soil.</p><p>This money continued to be a tender in law, and to be received in all payments due the public. From seventeen hundred and ninety, it was solely received by the Treasurer and public officers of the State; and as taxes increased, property sold under the confiscation requiring payments into the Treasury, other public demands, fines of courts and a variety of other causes, reduced this medium, and it was slowly, quietly, and almost unknowingly, so far absorbed by the Treasury, that the report of the Comptroller General, dated third December, eighteen hundred and elever., made in compliance with a call by the House of Representatives for information, shews that at that time there were outstanding, eleven thousand and nineteen dollars and eighty-seven and a half cents. Since that time there have been redeemed the sum of one thousand eight hundred and twenty-seven dollars and seventy four and a half cents, leaving an unredeemed balance against the State, of nine thousand one hundred and ninety-two dollars and thirteen cents, as appears from the report of the

them correctly kept, easy to be understood, and to correspond with the Comptrollers report. The known ability and integrity of that officer, would make it common place to attempt to compliment him.</p><p>Your committee are deeply impressed with a belief, that the state should adopt some means to withdraw her capital stock, from the Bank of Darien, either by purchasing up the capital stock owned by individuals at the market price, payable out of the interest accruing therefrom, in annual instalments, or refusing to recharter the institution, and bring its affairs to a close, as soon as the present charter expires; if the capital of that Bank, was added to the capital of the Central Bank, together with the balance remaining in the Treasury, at the close of the political year, eighteen hundred and thirty, it would furnish an addition capital of five hundred and four thousand five hundred thirty nine dollars, and twenty nine cents, added to the present active capital of that institution, would afford an additional annual interest of thirty thousand two hundred seventy one dollars and ninety five cents, which your committee believe, ought to be set apart, as a fund for defraying the annual expenses of the State, thereby affording a fund for that purpose, equal to one half of the State tax, now imposed, which would enable the State to relieve her citizens, of one half their present taxes, which is an object much to be desired in all countries, but more particularly in a republic like ours, where the government receives its powers, from the consent of the governed, who expect at the hands of the government, all the benefits derivable from a frugal economy of the public treasure.</p><p>Your committee are aware, that they may be considered by some, as obtruding their opinions upon the General Assembly, by allowing themselves too much latitude in their report, but they are equally aware that those most conversant with the fiscal concerns of the State, and the genius of her people, will see enough of prosperity in the measure alluded to, in this report, to furnish them with an apology for being thus elaborate. Our ideas may be visionary, yet we believe if such a policy as we recommend were adopted, and a judicious revision of our tax laws were made, the citizens of this State in a few years might be almost, if not altogether, relieved from taxation; besides too, the office of Treasurer, might be easily dispensed with, and his duties performed entirely by the bank. If such were the regulations, no pretext or motive could induce the legislature, to [Illegible Text] in the

Burch, have had the same under consideration, and report.</p><p>That by a resolution of the General Assembly, passed on the nineteenth day of December, eighteen hundred and twenty nine, a committee of three persons were appointed by his Excellency the Governor, to examine and report to the Governor, the quantity of work done by the said Burch, which is not contained in the specifications of a contract, entered into by the said Burch, with the State of Georgia, in building the new edition of the State House, also to make such reductions, as may seem just in the deficiency of the work c. The committee appointed by his Excellency, after performing the duties required of them, under the resolution as appears by their report, awarded to Charles C. Birch, the sum of thirteen hundred and fifty six dollars, and sixty eight cents, for work done and not contained in the specifications of his contract. The same committee, also report the amount of three hundred and forty eight dollars, and seventy two cents, as the value of the deficiencies, in the work done by the said Birch, not being according to the specifications of his contract. It will be presumed therefore, by the report of said commissioners, that Mr. Birch, is entitled to the sum of one thousand  seven [Illegible Text]  ninety six cents. It is due to your committee to remark, that after a careful examination of two of the commissioners, as to the evidence before them, and on which they made up their report, to observe that there was introduced before your committee, new testimony in support of the claim of the said Birch, which was not before the commissioners appointed, under the resolution of the nineteenth day of December eighteen hundred and twenty nine. The testimony submitted to your committee, leads them to the following result. That in addition to the sum of one thousand and seven dollars, and ninety six cents, found due by the State, to the said Charles C. Birch, by the commissioners appointed by his Excellency, under the resolution of the nineteenth day of December eighteen hundred and twenty nine, that the said Birch, is entitled to the further sum of fifteen hundred and fifty one dollars, and sixty five cents, making in all the aggregate sum of twenty five hundred and fifty nine dollars, and sixty one cents. Your committee, whilst they admire the precaution used by his Excellency,

in guarding the Treasury of the State, and by no means [Illegible Text] his motive, in disagreeing to the report of the commissioners, are clearly of the opinion that the testimony introduced before your committee, explains away the evidence, upon which the Governor chiefly relied. It is worthy of remark that Mr. Marler, one of the commissioners who has found a clear balance of one thousand and seven dollars, and sixty five cents, in favour of Mr. Birch, has since funished his Excellency, with a written opinion varying in a material manner, the report which had received his sanction. Your committee therefore, beg to offer the following resolution.</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That his Excellency, be instructed and required to draw his warrant, in favour of Charles C. Birch, on the fund appropriated for the [Illegible Text] of the addition, to the State House, for the sum of one thousand and seven dollars, and seventy six cents, in full compensation for all demands which said Birch, has against the State of Georgia.</p><p>ASBURY HULL, Speaker.</p><p>Attest, W.
