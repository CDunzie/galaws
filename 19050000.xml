Be it enacted by the General Assembly of Georgia, and it is hereby enacted by authority of the same, That within thirty days after the passage of this Act, or as soon thereafter as practicable, it shall be the duty of the county board of education of each county in Georgia to lay off the county into school districts, the lines of which shall be clearly and positively defined by boundaries such as creeks, public roads, land-lot lines, district lines or county lines. By concurrent consent and action boards of education of two or more adjoining counties may lay off and define school districts without regard to county lines; provided, that the ordinary of the county in which the schoolhouse is located shall order the election. The school districts thus marked out shall contain an area of not less than sixteen square miles, and, where practicable, shall be so shaped as to have the school building as near the center as possible; provided, that the board of education may have the right to establish districts with areas less than sixteen (16) square miles where there are natural causes or local conditions that make it necessary to do so. The natural causes which will permit the creation of small districts are mountains, streams over which there are no bridges, and dangerous roads. Local conditions which will permit the creation of small districts must be determined by the board of education. In counties having incorporated towns, now levying a local tax for educational purposes and operating a public school system under their town charter or special Act of the Legislature, the county board of education, with the consent of the municipal authorities, may create a school district larger than the incorporated limits of the town by adding adjacent territory not already included in the incorporated limits, and the district thus marked out shall become a school district upon vote of the people as hereinafter provided, but such school district including incorporated towns having a population of four thousand or more

<page id="GA1905.1.P422" no="GA1905.1.426" />

shall be and remain under the exclusive supervision and direction of the school boards of the previously chartered schools in said class of incorporated towns and not under supervision of county boards of education, and the school boards of such chartered schools in incorporated towns shall be the trustees of said school district under this Act; provided further, that if there be located in such school districts a chartered school controlled by a board of stockholders or by a board of directors elected by them, the management and control of said chartered schools shall remain in them and they shall have all the rights and privileges of this Act to collect local tax as hereinafter provided in this Act, and to receive their share of the State public school fund. A map of the county thus laid off, plainly outlining the boundaries of the school districts, with full description thereof, shall be filed with the ordinary within forty days after the passage of this Act, or as soon thereafter as practicable; and the boundaries of said school district shall not be altered any oftener than two years. The county board of education, in laying off the county, shall disregard any school districts embracing territory not included in incorporated towns heretofore created by special Act of the Legislature. <sidenote>School districts</sidenote> <sidenote>Municipa and chartered schools.</sidenote> <sidenote>County map.</sidenote></p><p>SEC. 2. Be it further enacted, That whenever the citizens of any county wish to supplement the public school fund received from the State by levying a tax upon the property of the county, it shall be the duty of the ordinary to order an election not earlier than twenty days nor later than sixty days after receiving a petition from one-fourth of the qualified voters of the county; and notice of the same shall be published in at least three weekly issues of the county newspaper in which the legal advertisements for the county are published. Said election shall be held as ordinary county elections are held. Those favoring the levying of the local tax shall vote, For local tax for public schools; those opposed shall vote, Against local tax for public schools. The returns of said election shall be made to the ordinary of the county, who shall declare the result, and two-thirds of those voting shall be necessary to carry said election for local taxation for public schools. An election for the same purpose shall not be held oftener than every twelve months. No person shall be allowed to vote in said election except those regularly qualified to vote in State or county elections. If the election is carried for local taxation the ordinary or board of county commissioners, whichever levies the county tax, shall levy a local tax as recommended by the county board of education upon all the property

of the county, not to exceed one half of one per cent., and the same shall be collected by the county tax-collector and paid by him to the county board of education. The county tax-collector shall keep the funds thus collected separate and distinct from all county and State funds; provided, that if there be an incorporated town in a county holding an election as provided in this section, now operating a public school system, it shall not be included in the election without the consent of the municipal authorities, but if the municipal authorities should so wish, they may abolish their system by special Act of the Legislature, and avail themselves of the provisions of this bill. <sidenote>Local tax for public schools, county elections for.</sidenote></p><p>SEC. 3. Be it further enacted, That whenever the citizens of any school district, in a county not levying a local tax for educational purposes, wish to supplement the funds received from the State public school fund by levying a local tax for educational purposes, they shall present a petition from one-fourth of the qualified voters of the district to the ordinary, who shall order the election not earlier than twenty days nor later than sixty days after the petition is received; provided, that notice of the same shall be posted in at least three conspicuous places in the district, ten days prior to the election. The election shall be held at the time and place prescribed by the proper county authorities and under rules governing ordinary special elections. Those favoring local taxation for public schools shall vote: For local taxation for public schools; those opposed shall vote: Against local taxation for public schools. The returns of said election shall be made to the ordinary of the county, who shall declare the result, and two-thirds of those voting shall be necessary to carry the election for local taxation for public schools. No person shall vote in said election except regularly qualified voters residing in the district, six months prior to the election. At the same time and place, in the same election, there shall be elected a board of trustees for said district, composed of three intelligent citizens of good moral character who are known to be earnest supporters of public education, and they shall serve, one for three years, one for two years, one for one year, as the county board of education may determine. The notice of their election shall be filed by the election managers with the county school commissioner, who shall submit the same to the county board of education for their approval. After the said local board of trustees has been approved and properly commissioned by the county board of education, it shall meet immediately and organize by electing one of its number president and one secretary and treasurer. If the

county board of education should consider any member or members thus elected unqualified for the work, they shall refuse to confirm the election of such a member or members, and require the citizens of the district at a time and place, and in a manner prescribed by the county board of education, to elect others. At the expiration of the term of office of the members thus elected, the citizens of the district shall meet at a time and place and in a manner prescribed by the county board of education, and elect their successors, who must be approved by the county board of education as hereinbefore provided, and the election shall hold for a term of three years. If any member should refuse to act or should be guilty of any conduct unbecoming the dignity of a school trustee, the county board of education shall have the right, upon a written complaint of a majority of the voters of the district, to remove said member and have his successor elected as hereinbefore provided. <sidenote>District elections.</sidenote> <sidenote>Trustees for district schools.</sidenote></p><p>SEC. 4.

They shall determine the amount necessary to be raised by local tax on all the property of the district and shall proceed to collect it in the following manner: The secretary of the board of trustees, with the aid of the county school commissioner, shall ascertain from the tax digest of the county the tax returned on all property in said school district, and by the first day of October in each year shall levy such a rate on the property thus found that will raise the total amount to be collected; provided, that said rate shall not exceed three-quarters of one per cent. The local board of trustees shall have the right to collect the tax semi-annually or annually, as they deem best, through the secretary and treasurer of the board of trustees, who shall give bond to the trustees in an amount not less than double that to be collected by the district. If payment of the local tax on any property of the district is not paid by the twentieth day of December then the secretary and treasurer of the local board of trustees shall have the authority to issue a fi. fa. against such property and proceed to collect the same just as the county taxcollector collects delinquent State and county taxes. <sidenote>Board of trustees, authority of.</sidenote> <sidenote>Local tax, how colected.</sidenote></p><p>SEC. 5.
