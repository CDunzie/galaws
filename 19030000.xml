All provisions of this Act applicable to the hiring of this class of convicts, their control and management, shall be of force until expiration of the contracts hereby authorized. The advertisements shall be published as required in section 8, offering for hire for a term not longer than five years all the convicts not embraced in section 8 of this Act, and not furnished the county authorities as provided in section 10, to be employed at any labor consistent with the reasonable punishment and the physical ability of the convict; provided, that the convicts shall, as far as possible, consistent with the best interests of the State, be so worked that the products of their labor shall come least in competition with that of free labor; provided further, that in no case shall convicts be worked in factories where women are employed; the State furnishing all guards and physicians; the hirer furnishing transportation, maintenance, medicine, clothing and all other necessaries, and such buildings as may be required (which shall be stated in the advertisement), and paying quarterly for the annual labor of the convicts at an agreed price per annum per capita. At the time fixed in the advertisement the commission shall award said convicts, or any of them, to the bidder or bidders who offer the highest and best price for labor, but may reject any and all such bids, and may make any other contract of hiring on the plan specified, which, in their judgment, will carry out the intentions of this Act and subserve the best interest of the State. No lessee of convicts as herein provided for shall sublease any of said convicts to any person other than such as shall be approved by said commission, and only upon such terms as said commission shall prescribe. The commission in hiring the convicts may contract with any one or more persons or companies, but no bids for less than twenty-five nor more than fifty convicts shall be received in any one bid; provided, that this does not restrict any person, firm or corporation from making more than one bid, so that said firm or corporation may receive more than one group of fifty and the minimum price to be considered shall be $175.00 per year; and all convicts sentenced after April 1, 1904, to the penitentiary shall be disposed of by the commission under

All contracts made shall provide for suitable bond, with security to be approved by the commission, to be made by the hiring person or company, payable to the Governor and his successors in office, in an amount to be fixed by the commission, conditional for the faithful payment of the hire and observance of the contract, and of such rules and regulations as may be adopted by the commission; and that whenever any such bond is executed by the hirer of said convicts as herein contemplated, the State shall have a lien on all the property of said principal, and security or securities of said bond from the time of the execution thereof for the payment of any and all liabilities arising from the breach of said bond. In lieu of a personal bond the company or individual hiring the convicts may deposit collateral, consisting of United States bonds, or municipal bonds, which are acceptable to the commission, or the company or individual hiring the convicts may give as security any solvent guarantee company, security company, surety company, fidelity insurance company, which has complied with the Act of December 24, 1896, authorizing such companies to become surety upon bonds; and in case of default the bond shall be collectable as provided in said Act of December 24, 1896. Whenever the surety upon any bond shall become doubtful, the commission shall have authority to require other good and solvent security, and, in default of such security being given, the commission may forfeit the lease and take charge of the convicts. The hire shall be paid into the treasury of the State at the end of each three months from the date of the hiring upon certified statement submitted by the commission to the Comptroller-General, ten days being allowed to pay the hire after such statement has been filed. The prison commission is authorized and required, between the months of August, 1903, and March, 1904, after advertising as required above, to make contracts under the provisions of this Act for the labor of all felony convicts not embraced in section 8 for a period of five years, beginning April 1, 1904.
