This happens where the widow, from necessity, convenience,

<page id="GA1870.3.P88" no="GA1870.3.89" />

or any cause, is compelled to move from the dwelling house, and thus place it in the possession of the representatives, which she has the right to hold until her dower is assigned. Strange to say, that except by implication, and that too remote for certainty, there is no provision in our law for the enforcement of her claim to dower in property which cannot be divided in kind, by procuring a decree for its sale, and having the money value of her dower paid to her. By section 1761 this can be done in any or all of the dowerable property; <i>but by the assent of the executor or administrator only;</i> and when such have combined against the widow, of course they will <i>not</i> assent. See sections on subject of dower, the assignment of dower and partition.
