of Louisiana by the United States from France, with the same limits and boundaries ceded to France by Spain, that government has uniformly refused, and does now forcibly retain possession of a part of said territory, including the town of Mobile, obviously within the limits of said territory thus purchased, in violation of that good faith which should always subsist between nations not at war with each other; and that the government of Spain being now in the hands of a Regency, not recognized by the United States as legitimate authority; independently of this, the alliance between Spain and Great-Britain, with whom we are now at war, renders it in the opinion of your memorialists, highly expedient, nay, indispensably necessary, that your honorable body should adopt efficient measures to authorise the President of the United States to take immediate possession of the province of East Florida, as well as that portion of West [Illegible Text], purchased from France, but still retained by Spain. The contiguity of the province of East Florida to the state they represent, together with the influence which it has had, and may have upon the Indians within the boundaries of the United States, makes it necessary for the safety and interests of the states generally, and that of their southern frontier in particular, to take measures to occupy immediately the province in question by the forces of the United tates; your memorialists are impelled to this recommendation for a consideration of the following facts;</p><p>1st. That the port and island of Amelia belonging to the Province of East Florida is a rendezvous for smugglers, whose patriotism has long since been prostrated at the shrine of avarice, and

<page id="GA1812.1.P132" no="GA1812.1.135" />

who by ministering to their own rapacity, violate the laws of the Union, and strengthen the enemy by treasonably affording them aid and comfort, there by prolonging the war, which the injustice and oppression of Great Britain has compelled the United States to declare against her.</p><p>2d. That by suffering the province of East Florida to remain in the possession of Spain during the present contest with Great Britain, with whose government Spain is in intimate alliance, we may reasonably expect reinforcements from the Havannah or elsewhere, of British and Spanish forces; which acting in conjunction with their savage allies, already in the province, must inevitably eventuate in the destruction of the frontier inhabitants of this state. Add to this the difficulty with which we could take possession of the fortress of St Augustine, (if indeed it be practicable at all) when in possession of a competent force.</p><p>3d. That in the event of a strong force, either British or Spanish, occupying East Florida and the island of Cuba at the same time, the whole trade of the western states bordering on the Mississippi, must be totally annihilated; that being the key to the entrance of the Mississippi, and being in possession of the enemy, our vessels would have to sail around the Island of Hispaniola, which would expose them to the danger of falling inevitable victims to British cruisers.</p><p>Your memorialists would not presume to enter into a further detail of facts, which are so well known to your honorable body, and by whom they trust so justly appreciate, believing as they do, that every friend to the peace and safety of this country will cordially unite in effectuating an object

<page id="GA1812.1.P133" no="GA1812.1.136" />

by which the chances of speedily terminating the war, will be so greatly multiplied.</p><p>Your memorialists are aware that the provisions of the constitution of the United States forbid any state from engaging in war, unless actually invaded, and in such [Illegible Text] danger as will not admit of delay That this danger exists, and that the persons and property of citizens resident in the South Eastern section of the state they represent, cannot be considered safe, while the war continues with England, and East Florida remains in the possession of Spain her ally; That the sovereignty of the state has been invaded by the murder of one man and the wounding another within the limits of the state of Georgia, by the Indians residing in the province of East Florida; and where is the difference in the criminality of the act (they beg leave to ask), between the commission of a crime by the subjects of Spain in East Florida, and its commission by a people resident in the province, and whom they supply with arms, ammunition and protection? that this is the fact cannot, will not be denied, when it is recollected that not only the Indians in the province are provided for and protected, but that, a general invitation has issued from the fortress at Augustine to the blacks in the province, to take [Illegible Text] in the fort, and they will be furnished with arms and implements of war necessary for the execution of their nefarious purposes.</p><p>Your memorialists would further state, that nothing but that reverential respect which they ever felt, now feel, and will ever feel for the constitution of these states, has thus long [Illegible Text] them from avenging the manifold injuries they have received, and so long supported from the minions

This diminution of the original deposit, has been too clearly and satisfactorily accounted for and explaned in the communication of His Excellency,

<page id="GA1812.1.P161" no="GA1812.1.164" />

to require any elucidation from your committeeIt only remains for them to ascertain whether it is in the power of the General Assembly to make any application of the stock purchased by Gen. Mathews, then Governor of this state</p><p>The sum invested in the purchase of this stock, amounted to 49,445 dollars 50 cents, and was taken from the Yazoo Deposit and considered as a representative of the money with which it had been bought. The purchase was made in the name of the state, and is therefore at the disposal of the state, if she thought proper to exercise control over it But as a representative of so much of the original deposit, it partakes of its character, and must be identified with it. The constitutional principle, however, which inhibits the application or appropriation of the Yazoo Deposit as a part of the funds of this state, cannot interfere with the application of the interest which bath accrued upon the said stock, the whole of which, or nearly the whole, as His Excellency has represented is still due. If there is any difference between the sum directed to be invested in the purchase of six per cent stock,  that really so invested, which would now produce the diminution of capital, it has arisen as your committee presume, from the expenses and commissions incidental to said investment. Be this, however, as it may, the proprietors of the Yazoo Deposit can have no possible claim upon the interest of this stock, and for this obvious and cogent reason, because neither constitutionally or legally can they demand more than the amount they have deposited. Your committee are therefore of the opinion, that the said interest may be considered as a part of the funds of this state. Your committee recommend,

<page id="GA1812.1.P162" no="GA1812.1.165" />

that the amount of stock be drawn in money from the Treasury of the United States, and deposited as a part of the balance of said Yazoo Fund.</p><p>Your committee are also of the opinion, that the bills of the Bank of the United States, and all other bills composing a part of the balance of the Yazoo Deposit be converted into gold and silver.
