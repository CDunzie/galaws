<notediv><title>PREFACE.<br set="CENTER" /></title><note><p>The laws comprised in this volume are printed from the engrossed copies, which are those which pass the two branches of the General Assembly. After their passage through the two Houses, they are enrolled, and the enrolled copies are those which are signed by the Governor, or become laws over his veto, or by the expiration of the time limited by the Constitution. The enrolled copies are those deposited in the archives of the State in the Secretary of State's office. The enrolled and engrossed copies should be counterparts of each other, but sometimes variations occur from clerical errors and omissions. These Acts, printed from the engrossed copies, have been carefully compared with the enrolled copies deposited in the office of the Secretary of State, and any material omissions or variations are noted by enclosing the different reading in brackets.</p><p>It was thought best by his Excellency, Governor Smith, on the score of convenience and economy, to include the Acts passed at the short session in January, in this compilation, and by his order this has been done.</p><p>For convenience in searching for any law in the Secretary of State's office, I have affixed to each Act the original number it bears on the files, (thus O. No. 00.)</p><p>DAVID G. COTTING.</p><p>Secretary of State, and Compiler.</p></note></notediv>

actually paid out for said object; and, whereas, the improvement of harbors and navigable waters is one of national concern, the expense of which should be borne by all the people, and paid out of the treasury of the general government. Now, therefore, be it <sidenote>Preamble.</sidenote></p><p><i>Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of Georgia in General Assembly met</i>, That Congress is hereby respectfully and earnestly requested to appropriate a sum of money sufficient to reimburse the city of Savannah for the expenditures made by said city for improving the navigation of the harbor of Savannah. And be it further <sidenote>Request Congress to reimburse Savannah for sums expended on harbor.</sidenote></p><p><i>Resolved</i>, That a copy of the foregoing preamble, and these resolutions, duly certified in duplicate, be forwarded to the Mayor of Savannah, to be laid before the two Houses of Congress at their present session.</p><approvaldate>Approved December 13th, 1871.</approvaldate></law><law id="R1871V1N242" initial.page="261"><lawnbr>(No. 16.)</lawnbr><fulltitle><i>Memorial relative to Water Communication between the Atlantic and Mississippi.</i></fulltitle><p>The General Assembly of the State of Georgia to the Congress of the United States, respectfully represent, that there is a necessity for a shorter, cheaper and better channel of communication between the Mississippi Valley and the Atlantic seaboard. <sidenote>Canal from the Mississippi to the Atlantic.</sidenote></p><p>That such a channel can be obtained through Georgia by connecting the waters of the Tennessee and Coosa rivers, and the Coosa and Ocmulgee rivers by canal.</p><p>That the benefit to be derived from the work, when completed, would be enjoyed equally by the Eastern and Western States of the Union, and that, in case of a hostile invasion, it would be invaluable to the Government as an interior means of communication by which supplies, in large quantities, could be cheaply and safely transported from the West to the East, and that, for these reasons it may justly and properly be considered a national work.</p><p>That the impoverished condition of the South precludes the hope that this work can be successfully prosecuted, either as a State work, or by private enterprise, for many years.</p><p>The necessity for a work such as is contemplated, is clearly shown by the present charges upon the transportation of grain from the Western States to New York. The charge on wheat from the Mississippi river to New York by railway, when the canals are closed, averages seventy-two (72) cents per bushel, and even by water transportation from Chicago, the charges sometimes amount to fifty-six (56) cents per bushel; or above sixty-two (62) cents per bushel from the Mississippi river, so that the farmer west of that river has to pay one

<page id="GA1871.1.P257" no="GA1871.1.262" />

half of his crop to get the other half to market. In fact, the charges on wheat from the northwest are so onerous as seriously to cripple the development of that section, and to render it doubtful whether there be any profit in raising it.</p><p>That this state of things is produced by the present inadequate means of transportation; the pressure upon the present water routes being so great during the limited season between the harvesting of the crops and the closing of navigation, exorbitant prices are demanded for freight, and the distance, by railroad is so great that transportation can never be brought down to a price that will leave a sufficient profit to the farmer, and at the same time be remunerative to the railroads. High rates of freight depress agricultural interests, especially in the States west of the Mississippi, and check emigration.</p><p>These evil influences can only be remedied, the agricultural interests of the west fostered and developed, and emigration encouraged, by opening some cheaper channel of trade between the Mississippi and the Atlantic ocean.</p><p>The multiplication or consolidation of long lines of railroads can never effect the desired results, as the distance is too great for wheat and corn to be transported at a profit.</p><p>A cheap transit can be found for the west through Georgia to the sea, by opening the proposed water line. It is eight hundred and forty-four (844) miles less from St. Louis, the great centre of western trade, to the Georgia Atlantic ports, than to New York by the lakes and Erie canal.</p><p>It is two hundred and eighty-two (282) miles less from St. Louis, by the proposed line, to the Georgia ports, than to the Gulf of Mexico, by the Mississippi river.</p><p>This route will be safe in war and in peace, It will never be obstructed by ice. Upon it no transhipments will be necessary. No marine insurance will be needed.</p><p>A barge loading at any point on the Mississippi, or any of its tributaries, can discharge her cargo on board a vessel at Brunswick or Savannah, without in the meantime breaking bulk.</p><p>The two principal seaports of Georgia have harbors that are safe and accessible to sloops, (ships) and seagoing steamers of ordinary capacity, at all times, and are ample to accommodate this trade.</p><p>By this proposed line, freight can be transported from St. Louis to Savannah for four dollars and fifty-six cents per ton, and corn for twelve cents per bushel. Being, for the greater part of the way, a river route, it would, at all times afford the cheapest mode of transportation known to the commercial world.</p><p>The estimated cost of this work, within the limits of Georgia, will not exceed ten millions of dollars. The saving which would be effected upon the transportation of the grain crops of the West, would pay for it in one year, did it cost ten times as much as the above estimate.</p>

<p>It will supply the great need of the West, and furnish it with what it has so long desired (viz) <i>cheap transportation</i>.</p><p>In our opinion, the cheapening of transportation which it will effect, will enable the United States, once more, to command the grain markets of Western Europe.</p><p>In short, there is no interest, either agricultural or mechanical, which it will not aid in developing, and no State in the Union which it will not, in some degree, benefit.</p><p>For these reasons we justly regard it as a great national work, which should receive the aid of the General Government, and we therefore respectfully ask that the Congress of the United States will in such way as shall seem to them best, either by a donation of land, or by a loan of the credit of the Government, furnish the means for opening this great continental highway.</p><p><i>Resolved</i>, 1.

when the accused may upon complying with the law respecting bail be bound over to appear before the proper Court for the trial of such a case and answer to the matters charged against him. If the felony be bailable, as aforesaid, and defendant cannot give the bail, said County Judge shall commit him to jail for safe keeping, so that his presence may be secured for trial before the proper Court to try such cases; and said County Judge, when the felony brought before him is bailable as above, shall have the right to admit to bail at any time until the Court which has jurisdiction of felonies shall meet. In cases which do not, upon examination, appear to be felonies, said County Judges shall have full authority and jurisdiction, as hereinafter provided, to hear, determine, sentence, decide and adjudicate upon the same, and to the same extent as the District Judges, under the Act of 1870, organizing for certain districts therein named District Courts, unless the party accused shall, in a writing, signed by him, demand an indictment by a grand jury of the county in which the misdemeanor was committed. In that case, said County Judge shall require of defendant demanding such indictment good bond and security to appear and answer to such indictment, if found at such time and place, and before such tribunal as the said indictment may be tried. If no such bond and security is given, then said County Judge shall commit to jail for safe keeping the person so accused and demanding an indictment until the proper grand jury can act upon the charge, and until the case can be legally determined. If an indictment is found by said grand jury, the Judge of the Superior Court may, if he chooses so to do, order said indictment to be returned, with all the papers pertaining to said case, to the County Judge, to be disposed of by him after ten days' notice to the parties accused and the prosecutor, as others are disposed of by him in which no indictment has been demanded. In cases which do not appear to be felonies, and in which no indictment is demanded by the parties charged with misdemeanors, and in cases of misdemeanors upon which an indictment has been found and returned to the County Judge for trial, said County Judge shall immediately proceed to hear and determine said cases, unless a continuance shall be asked for, or jury is demanded as hereinafter provided; which continuance, if it falls within the rules for the continuance of criminal cases in the Superior Court, shall be granted to such time as is proper and just under the circumstances. If parties accused shall not ask a continuance, or shall be refused a continuance, and shall demand a jury to try their case instead of the County Judge, then the case shall be postponed until a jury can be summoned for such trials, and jurors shall be thus procured: Said County Judge shall, from the list of persons liable to do jury duty in the county wherein he presides, make a list, and putting their names in a box kept for that purpose, drawn by lot the names of twelve jurors, who shall be summoned by the same bailiff already provided for in this Act, (he being hereby fully authorized to execute all warrants, orders, writs and precepts

The accused shall have no right of peremptory challenge to this jury so summoned; but may show any of them not to be free from legal exception if he can, and if he can, and if such exception is sustained by the County Judge, other persons liable to serve as jurors shall be summoned by said bailiff, as tales jurors are summoned in the Superior Court, until the jury of twelve men is obtained. In order to procure an impartial jury, the County Judge shall ask the jurors under oath, (which he may administer), such questions as will ascertain the mental condition of the jury, and if any are found incompetent, according to the rules provided in the Code, he shall, as above, have tales jurors summoned until an impartial jury can be procured. If the verdict of said jury, which shall have the same power and duties as juries in criminal cases in Superior Courts, as to law and facts, shall be against defendant, he shall be sentenced as in cases where the County Judge alone tries the case. The County Judge shall have the right to try any and all of the criminal cases which may properly come before him at any place in the county where he is Judge, and his judgment and decision shall be subject to review by <i>certiorari</i> as hereinafter provided. <sidenote>Powers in criminal cases.</sidenote> <sidenote>Bail in criminal cases.</sidenote> <sidenote>Cases not felonies.</sidenote> <sidenote>Continuances.</sidenote> <sidenote>Juries, how drawn.</sidenote> <sidenote>How summoned.</sidenote> <sidenote>Perempt'ry challenges notallowed</sidenote> <sidenote>Tales jurors.</sidenote> <sidenote>Conviction and sentence.</sidenote> <sidenote>Decision may be reviewed by certiorari.</sidenote></p><p>Sec. XII. In cases where no indictment of the grand jury is demanded, the County Judge shall frame a written accusation, founded upon the affidavit charging the defendant, said accusation to be in the name of the State of Georgia, signed by the prosecutor, and distinctly setting forth the nature of the offense charged, the time when committed, where and by whom, and that it is based upon said affidavit breifly referring to it; to this accusation defendant may demur for insufficiency, or plead to the merits, and if the accusation is held insufficient, the County Judge shall frame another and another until one is adjudged legally sufficient, but in no case shall the person accused be discharged for such insufficiency until full opportunity is allowed to prepare the sufficient accusation; when the case is submitted to the County Judge upon the pleadings as above set forth, (defendant being allowed full opportunity to plead and defend as in criminal cases in the Superior Court,) the County Judge shall give both parties, accuser and accused, time, if necessary, for a fair and impartial hearing, and said County Judge shall, on the trial, before him or a jury, make a thorough and careful examination of all the witnesses and testimony, and in no case allow either the State or accused to be prejudiced from any want of an examination or cross-examination; if the witnesses in the case before him, after the case is submitted upon the evidence and law, the County Judge or the jury, if a jury is demanded, shall in ascertaining the guilt or innocence of the party accused, be governed by the same rules as govern juries in criminal cases in the Superior Court; if the decision of

the County Judge, or the verdict of the jury, is against the defendant, said County Judge shall at once sentence the accused according to law and the rules of law governing Judges of the Superior Courts in sentencing parties found guilty of misdemeanors. If the decision of the Couny Judge, or the verdict of the jury, is in favor of the accused, he shall be discharged from the accusation so tried, and when said Judge or jury shall believe the accusation to be malicious, such Judge or jury may so find, and assess all the costs against the accuser; so, also, in all cases where the accuser shall fail to prosecute the case said Judge shall order that the accuser shall pay all the costs of the case from beginning to end, inclusive with the jail fees. <sidenote>Offenses when no indictment is demanded.</sidenote> <sidenote>Defendant to plead or demur to accusation</sidenote> <sidenote>If the accusation is insufficient</sidenote> <sidenote>Trial in criminal cases.</sidenote> <sidenote>Malicious accusation</sidenote></p><p>Sec. XIII. Whenever said County Judge shall adjudge that costs to are be paid either by the accused or prosecutor, the costs shall be assessed as follows: in all cases begun but not tried, $2 00 shall be paid (by the party adjudged liable) to the County Judge, and the same sum to the bailiff; in all cases tried by the County Judge or by him and a jury, the costs to be paid him by the party held liable shall be $3 00, and the sum of $2 00 to the bailiff, said bailiff shall, however, when he summons a jury or serves subp[UNK]nas for witnesses have extra fees as follows: for each juror 20 cents and for each subp[UNK]na 10 cents, all of the costs assessed for the County Judge shall be paid over by him to the county treasurer as fast as received, and an account given of the same at each term of the Court to the grand jury. If said County Judge shall use any of said costs or fail to turn over the same, he shall be liable, criminally, as county treasurer, under the 4368 section of the Code; Whenever the bailiff shall not be able to collect his costs on account of poverty or insolvency of the defendant, he shall be allowed the same from the fines and forfeitures hereinafter mentioned, and costs paid over to the county treasurer from cases in the County Court, and in all cases when an accusation is made by any person, the County Judge is hereby required to use the same proceedings to secure the costs of the cases presented to him, as the Code requires of Justices of the peace issuing criminal warrants, not, however, exacting security. When a party is adjudged liable in a criminal proceeding to pay costs or fines, or both, the same shall be collected as costs and fines are collected in the Superior Courts. Whatever fines and forfeitures are collected by virtue of sentence or judgment of the County Court Judge, they shall be collected and paid over to the county treasurer of each county. Said County Judge shall have jurisdiction to determine forfeitures, as other money demands, unless the amount involved exceeds his jurisdiction, when the bond shall be turned over to be forfeited in the Superior Courts, and all money collected thereon, save the expense of collection, shall be paid over by the County Judge to the county treasurer. <sidenote>Costs, how assessed.</sidenote> <sidenote>Bailiff's fees.</sidenote> <sidenote>Insolvent costs.</sidenote> <sidenote>Forfeiture of bonds.</sidenote></p><p>Sec.

This petition shall state the grounds of complaint, and give a brief of the material evidence and be duly sworn to. If, upon examination, the Judge of the Superior Court shall consider the petitioner entitled to a writ of <i>certiorari</i>, it shall be his duty to issue such writ, directed to the County Judge aforesaid as in civil cases, requiring him to certify and send up to him a complete and accurate history of the case so tried, which shall be called his answer, and which shall be subject to correction and traverse as is provided in section 3990 of the Code, and 3994 of the Code, except that said Judge of the Superior Court shall try said traverse. Said Judge of the Superior Court shall hear and determine said <i>certiorari</i> and return at any time after ten days' notice is given to the accuser, and then may pass such judgment or sentence as, in review of the whole case, is consistent with justice. In all cases where the County Judge alone tries the case, such Superior Courts on <i>certiorari</i> may pass such sentence or judgment as is consistent with law. No application for <i>certiorari</i>, however, in a criminal case shall be entertained unless the party applying will make the affidavit set down in section six of the Act of 1868, as follows: That no writ of <i>certiorari</i> shall be granted unless the accused shall first have field his affidavit setting forth that he has not had a fair trial, and that he has been wrongly and illegally convicted, and unless the party applying shall give such bond and security or make such affidavit as is permitted in the Code of Georgia, for parties in criminal cases carrying up cases to the Supreme Court of Georgia. <sidenote>Certiorari in criminal as in civil cases.</sidenote> <sidenote>Petition for certiorari to set forth grounds of error.</sidenote> <sidenote>Judge of Superior Court to issue writ.</sidenote> <sidenote>Applicat'n for certiorari to be made on affidavit.</sidenote></p><p>Sec.
