An agreement thus filed, shall be known as a Court Contract, and shall have the force and effect of a judgment or decree, for the specific performance of its terms both as to the express stipulations, and the plain duties and obligations resulting therefrom, by implication of law, <i>provided,</i> that all issues of fact arising under a Court contract, by the provisions of this Act, shall be tried by a jury, where either party demands it. Performance of these stipulations, duties and obligations, may, from day to day, and from time to time, be enforced by the County Court, by orders entered on the minutes for that purpose; which orders may be carried into effect by attachment for contempt, or any other writ, execution, or process, known to the law, and used in any Court, for affording redress to parties, or for maintaining its own authority, and dignity. Damages for a breach of such contract, may be awarded by similar orders, and payment thereof enforced by like means, and at the election of the party aggrieved, the contract may be declared rescinded, and such

party restored to his original situation as nearly as possible. Any other order requisite to the attainment of substantial justice, in the particular case, may also be passed and enforced; the Court always keeping in view, as cardinal points, that each party is to be compelled to perform his contract, or to forfeit, for any material default, the whole, or a part of its benefits, and in addition thereto, to make full and fair compensation, to the opposite party, for any damage occasioned by a breach thereof. In construing the contract, time is to be regarded as of the essence of the same; unless rendered impossible by the act of God, or the act of law, whatever is stipulated to be done by either party, must be done at the very time or times specified. At the expiration of the term fixed by the contract, the relation established thereby, shall cease, without notice to or from either party. The power of the County Court, by appropriate orders, to compel payments, or to award, and collect damages, or to place the parties in their former situation, shall nevertheless continue subject only to the condition that any order for one or more of these purposes, shall be applied for, within two months after the expiration of the time limited in the contract, for its full and final performance. Breaches not thus proceeded for, may be the subject of regular suit or action at any time, within the statutory period applicable to similar actions on other contracts. <sidenote>What agreements may be filed in County Court.</sidenote> <sidenote>Force and effect.</sidenote> <sidenote>Proviso.</sidenote> <sidenote>Performance enforced.</sidenote> <sidenote>Damages.</sidenote> <sidenote>Rescission.</sidenote> <sidenote>Other action of Court.</sidenote> <sidenote>Construing contract.</sidenote> <sidenote>Limit as to time.</sidenote></p><p>3.
