Ambitious and designing men have some times risen to power, and by torturing the Constitution, have enacted laws reckless of the provisions or prohibitions of that sacred instrument; but their career has been limitedtheir obnoxious measures indignantly condemnedtheir partial and

<page id="GA1841.1.P209" no="GA1841.1.210" />

unequal enactments repealed, and the Government transferred from Federal to Republican hands.</p><p>It lights up and brightens the patriot's hopes that this Government will endure, when he remembers how shortlived has been the domination of assumed and constructive power, and how soon those principles which are based upon their limitations, and which recognize the Constitution as their only legitimate source, have been re-established by the triumphant verdict of the American people.</p><p>Eternal vigilance, it is truly said, is the price of liberty; and it is only by the most uuceasing zeal and laborious industry, rousing the latent republicanism of the land, and giving vigor to every movement, that so many and such signal victories have been achieved by the Republican party, enabling them to detect and expose the insidious efforts of their opponents, first to mislead, and then to betray the people into the support of measures in direct hostility to their own rights, and calculated to evolve the most perilous effects on the integrity and independence of the country.</p><p>The Committee believe that a crisis has again arrived sufficient to awaken the anxiety, excite the solicitude, and stimulate the exertions of every lover of free institutions and guarded limitations of power; and it is only by sounding the alarm in season, and apprizing the people of the approaching and apprehended danger, that we may expect to arrest the evils which threaten the Republic, from the adoption of a system of measures at variance with the constitutional policy of the country, and fatal to the essential principles of our civil institutions.</p><p>A new administration, attaining power by the most lavish promises of economy, retrenchment and reform, is scarcely in possession of the ensigns of command, when its movements attract attention, and are sufficiently marked to afford cause for alarm to all acquainted with the elevated principles upon which the Government was founded, and competent to take an enlarged view of its political relations.</p><p>The convocation of Congress and the motive alleged for the act, that of supplying an exhausted treasury, and the immediate introduction and adoption of measures tending to defeat the pretended purpose for which it was convened, by draining the treasury, furnish abundant proof to every man not blinded by party zeal, or dazzled with the lust of power, of a secret and premeditated design to cousummate a system of most objectionable measures, of which the people had received no notice, and that were carefully concealed during the progress of the Presidential canvass. No more conclusive evidence is requisite to establish the mischievous views of the dominant party, and their full appreciation of the odious and unpopular character of the measures

<page id="GA1841.1.P210" no="GA1841.1.211" />

they intended thus surreptitiously to fasten on the country, than the particular period selected for the convocation of the late extra sessionat the close of one of the most animated political conflicts ever witnessed, and before time was given to allay the bad passions it had engendered. The specious and pretendedly imperative reasons assigned for its call, and the <i>real</i> motives so soon developed, and so totally different, however they may be viewed by honest, though mistaken party zeal, must and will receive the stern condemnation of impartial history.</p><p>The system of legislation adopted, was scarcely less reprehensible than the measures submitted. The infringement of the right of debate in the House of Representativesdenying to it the character of a deliberative bodythe rapid and indecent haste with which the most important laws, of the most searching and pervading character, were passed; the combinations and organizations so anti-republican in their character, and so dangerous in their tendency, by which the support of one measure was made to depend upon that of anotherthus securing the adoption of alland the general unblusing and reckless management on the part of the majority, looking alone at the ends, regardless of the means by which they were attained, have no parallel, it is believed, in the legislation of a people governed by a written Constitution.</p><p>Not only have the rules of legislation adopted at the extra session of Congressthe character of the measures then proposed, and the unusual and extraordinary means resorted to, to secure their immediate passageimpressed with serious apprehensions the impartial individuals of every party, and led them to fear the introduction into the administration of the General Government of a spirit of persecution, of exclusiveness, and of despotic action, at variance with the wholesome rules of American policy; but these apprehensions have been immeasurably strengthened by bold avowals of a determination to render inefficient one of the important and independent departments of the General Government.</p><p>It is not within the recollection of this Committee that, at any period since the formation of this Government, or at any moment even of the most embittered party excitement, when encouraged and elevated by the flattering prospect of wielding without control the whole power of the country, there has been even a wish expressed, much less a determination avowed, by those who composed a majority of one branch of the Government, to abridge and impair the constitutional powers of a co-ordinate department; and to obliterate one of those checks and balances which give strength and stability to our admirable political system, the preservation

<page id="GA1841.1.P211" no="GA1841.1.212" />

of each of which, with all its original powers and functions, can alone perpetuate the peace, harmony and integrity of the American confederacy.</p><p>Rallying under the deceptive and delusive declaration of <i>the</i> WILL OF THE NATION, <i>uncontrolled by the will of one man</i>, it is sought to concentrate all power in the hands of one branch. Shall we destroy the veto power because it is exercised by one man? If so, why not, with the same propriety, and for equally cogent reasons, destroy the power of the judiciary? It is a power equal in its sphere to either of the other two, and, in its negative operations, sometimes greater than both, as it may render the law void which has received the sanction both of Congress and the Executive, and this too, by the casting vote of ONE MAN, a single judge. In this organization of our political system, there is safetythere is stabilityderiving its weight from experience and sound philosophy; and yet an attempt is now making to abolish this power, and give exclusive control to one branch of the Government, and that, the least stable of the three; thus converting our admirable system, with its three separate and independent departmentseach restraining the excesses and correcting the errors of the othera system which has secured to us happiness and prosperity at home and political importance abroad, into a mere shadow, where every crude opinion may have weight; where inexpedient measures may be adopted, by aid of some influential impulse, as sudden and as short as it is violent; and where a party in periods of excitement, and governed by the prevailing delusions of the times, may urge measures in direct hostility to the solid interests of the people.</p><p>It has produced both regret and astonishment in the minds of this Committee, that acquiescence in this step, which contemplates nothing less than a radical change in our form of Government, by a concentration of its powers in one branch, instead of a division, as we now have it, into three, should have been not only readily yielded, but to our astonishment, recommended by a distinguished citizen of Georgia, the Honorable John McPherson Berrien, now holding the station of a Senator in the Congress of the United States. This Committee deny that in the course this Senator has pursued respecting the abolition or modification of the veto power, he consulted the wishes, the interests or opinions of the people of Georgia.</p><p>This Committee believe also that the same honorable Senator, in the support of the nomination of Mr. Everett, as Minister to England, consulted neither the good of the country, nor the feelings and interests of a vast majority of his constituents. The ground upon which opposition to that appointment is based, is believed by this Committee

<page id="GA1841.1.P212" no="GA1841.1.213" />

to be a sound one, which, if it had been carried out by the rejection of Mr. Everett, would have exercised a salutary influence in allaying abolition movements, and thus have contributed both to the peace and security of the whole country.</p><p>It does indeed appear somewhat extraordinary to this Committee, that while we are resisting the agitation of the abolition question in every form whatever, as unconstitutional, dangerous, and tending to the dissolution of our glorious Union, characterizing by the harshest epithets, all who even by indirection give to it the slightest countenance, a southern Senator should be found to contribute to the elevation of one so obnoxious to our feelings and so hostile to our interest, and particularly of an individual who has avowed his abolition principles, in their most imposing form and amplest extent.</p><p>This Committee are compelled by an imperious sense of duty, to express their unqualified disapprobation of the course of the honorable Senator, upon the subject of a National Bank, and the bill to distribute the proceeds of the public lands among the Statesthe bankrupt bill, the revenue and loan bills, deeming most of them unconstitutional, and all of them unjust, oppressive and highly injurious in their effects, affording indications not to be misunderstood, of the loose and dangerous constitutional opinions which he entertains.</p><p>While this Committee are sensibly impressed with the wisdom of the Constitution, in prescribing such tenure to office as may guard against sudden ebullitions of feeling or the violence of party triumph, they feel themselves relieved from the delicate and responsible task of instruction, in accepting the invitation of the honorable Senator, in his address to the people of the United States, wherein he invokes the action of the legislative councils of the sovereign States of the Union. This Committee, fresh from their immediate constituents, and latest in communication with them, humbly claim to have ascertained the public will in relation to those great questions upon which the Senator has invoked the expression of that will; and in obedience to the Senator's requisition upon the Representatives of the People, to exert themselves to give it effect, they feel bound, for the information of the Senator, to condemn, in decided terms, the action of the honorable Senator upon all the great measures which are made the subject matter of this report.Nor can the Committee entertain the opinion, so adverse to the candor of the Senator in seeking the information, that the invocation was made on his part, under any other determination than to regard as obligatory the expression of the public will, and to give effect to that expression, or to yield his place to one who will.</p>

<p>This Committee cannot withhold the expression of their approbation of the Executive for his inflexible adherence to his constitutional opinions, under the most embarrassing circumstances, upon the subject of a Bank of the United States, by which the country has been spared yet longer from the blighting curse of a vast monied corporation, with power to sway the interests and control the business of the people of every section of this extended Republic. And the measures adopted by the party to which the President is attached, to bring disgrace and disrespect upon their official head, for the conscientious performance of a public duty, are not the least among the alarming indications, which, in the opinion of this Committee, ought to excite the apprehensions and enlist the exertions of the people.</p><p>The attempt made to bring odium upon the Chief Magistrate, by contumely cast upon him in the halls of Congress, in newspapers of his own political stamprepudiating the officer whom they had elevated to powerproclaiming him unworthy of confidence, for an exercise of the very authority which he had always claimed, of repairing the breach in the Constitution whenever an opportunity offered, does exhibit a disregard of one of the departments of the Governmenta contempt for the established institutions of the land, and a recklessness of party spirit, so pregnant with mischief, that, if not arrested, will relax attachment to the laws, engender dissensions pernicious and incurable among the supporters of a wholesome government, and operate to the destruction of all moral and political obligations: Wherefore,</p><p><list><item><p>1. <i>Resolved</i>, That this General Assembly, speaking in behalf of the whole people of Georgia, declares its undiminished confidence in the confederated system, which forms the Government of the United States.</p></item><item><p>2. <i>Resolved</i>, That the system, as it now stands, purely administered, will protect the rights and secure the interests and happiness of the whole people of the United States.</p></item><item><p>3. <i>Resolved</i>, That the powers expressly granted by the Constitution, and the exercise of those without which the granted powers cannot be carried into effect, are amply sufficient for all the purpose of an useful and efficient administration of our Government, leaving to the States all the reserved powers.</p></item><item><p>4. <i>Resolved</i>, That the distribution of the powers of the General Government, into three distinct and independent heads, Executive, Legislative and Judicial, affords evidence of the wisdom of the framers of the Constitution; and is the only safeguard of sectional rights, personal interest, and private property; and that the destruction or modification of the power of either, rendering it less independent or less efficient

of Poor Schools, referred by the Senatus Academicus to the Senate, and by that body to this Committee, beg leave to submit the following report:</p><p>From an inspection of the documents submitted, it appears that there are several counties in the State from which no report has been made of the number of poor children, by the Commissioners of Poor Schools. The Committee are induced to believe that such failures are for the reasons that in some of these counties there has been no organization of a Board of Commissioners under the law of 1840; and in others the returns may have been misplaced, (not, however, by this Committee.) The Committee have examined the returns placed in their care, and find in most of them that there is contained an account of the receipts and disbursements of the present year, together with the number of poor children, who in the opinion of the legal authorities are entitled to the provisions of the statute of the year 1840. There are in several of these returns no account of money transactions whatever, and in many of them there is only a partial estimate of the poor children.</p><p>In the last annual communication of his Excellency the Governor, the intelligence is contained that the sum now distributed among the several counties as a poor school fund, is twenty-one thousand and eighty-nine dollars and sixty-four cents. Your Committee were induced to learn, if possible, the entire number of children to participate in the disbursement of this fund; they have made the estimate accurately, so far as the reports in their hands contained the information; but as before stated, many of the counties having failed to transmit any report, and others a return only in part, the correct aggregate cannot be made. Enough is known to justify the Committee in reporting the number of poor children in the whole State, to be educated from the poor school fund to exceed thirty thousand. The sum set apart by law for the education of the poor children, when disbursed, gives only the poor sum of seventy cents to each child; an amount too inconsiderable to produce much good. The Committee are almost willing to recommend that the money now due be retained until a dividend shall arise upon the stock applicable to this object; they are restrained, however, from making such recommendation from the consideration that in many, if not all the counties from which reports have been made, engagements were entered into with teachers, for services the present year; the services have been rendered, the claims are due, and consequently should be satisfied at as early a day as possible. The Committee have no fault to urge to the laws providing for the education of the poor, and have only to lament that the fund is so inadequate.</p>

<page id="GA1841.1.P228" no="GA1841.1.229" />

<p>In conclusion of the duty devolving upon them under the reference, your Committee would recommend that payment from the poor school fund be delayed for a short period, say until the first day of February next, so as to give time and opportunity to commissioners, in counties where no returns of the poor children have been made, or only partly made, to furnish a full return thereof to the Executive office; and that the Executive be requested to delay any distribution of said fund, until the day aforesaid. And your Committee would further recommend the passage of the following resolution:</p><p><i>Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives</i>, That his Excellency the Governor cause to be published in two of the newspapers in Milledgeville, a notice to the Commissioners of Poor Schools, in counties where no returns of poor children have been made, requesting such Commissioners to make a report of the poor children in their respective counties, to the Executive office, by the first day of February next; and that the several Senators from the counties where no reports have been made, be requested to communicate this resolution to the Commissioners of Poor Schools, in their respective counties.</p><p>Agreed to, December 4th, 1841.</p><p>ROBERT M.

<p>We find upon examination of the report of the late Commissioners that they have, in pursuance of an act passed the last session of the Legislature, authorizing them to make a full settlement with the former Commissioners on said road, that they have attempted to perform that duty, but owing to a non-compliance on the part of the said former commissioners, they have been unable to accomplish said settlement.

<page id="GA1841.1.P253" no="GA1841.1.255" />

been such as your committee would deem to have been most advisable. The committee allude to the fact of undertaking to complete simultaneously both the buildings now under contract, believing as they do that one of them would have been amply sufficient for several years to come.</p><p>Some difficulty has been encountered by your committee in arriving at satisfactory information in relation to the contracts, growing mainly out of the irregularity in the mode of keeping the accounts of the commissioners, (a part of whom have been changed annually) from the manner in which they receive the appointments. But by reference to the appropriation made for the institute, it appears that there has been received from the treasury of the State the sum of thirty-four thousand dollars, which amount has been expended; and that for the payment for work that is already done, and which it will be necessary to complete the two buildings and furnish them with all the furniture, fixtures, c. absolutely necessary, the further sum of twenty thousand dollars will be required.</p><p>But your committee would suggest the propriety of completing and furnishing the building which is now nearly in a state of readiness to receive subjects, and prosecuting the work on the other building only so far as is necessary to protect it from the weather. This will be effected by covering it, hanging the outside doors, setting the glass, c. The brick, door shutters, window casings, sash and glass are furnished ready to be put up; and it is only necessary to complete the masonry and cover the building to put it in a condition in which it may remain for many years without material damage. To do this, and pay the amount now due to contractors, which are ascertained to be about twelve thousand dollars, will require the sum of fifteen thousand dollars, an amount which it has been hoped the Legislature, with a view of all the facts before them would be induced to appropriate.</p><p>The plan and arrangement of the buildings, and the general economy proposed to be adopted in the organization and government of the institution, so far as your committee can learn, are such as have been adopted in the best arranged similar institutions of the United States; and it is a subject of gratulation and pride to us as philanthropists and patriots, that in no portion of the world have the fruits of this humane system been more abundant than in our own country.</p><p>Statistical facts, although varying in different countries, from the influence of both moral and physical causes, prove that the proportion of insane varies from one in a thousand to one in two thousand inhabitants; and if epileptics be taken into the account, the number will be at least doubled.

<page id="GA1841.1.P254" no="GA1841.1.256" />

The number of white inhabitants of the State of Georgia, who are idiots and insane, is ascertained to be near three hundred; add to these epileptics and the number will probably be about five hundred.</p><p>That such members of the Legislature as are not conversant with the results of treatment in Lunatic Asylums may have some idea of them as reported by similar institutions in other States, your committee deem it not inappropriate to call their attention to a few extracts from reports of the Massachusetts State Asylum, at Worcester, generally admitted to be the best institution of the kind in the United States. That institution has been in operation for eight years, and within that period has received eleven hundred and ninety-six subjects, of which number five hundred and six have been positively and permanently restored, and one hundred and thirty-two greatly improved. Among the number many had been the subjects of this most distressing of all conditions to which the human being is liable for from four to twelve years. But to exhibit the very great importance of early attention to that unfortunate class of our fellow creatures, it is shown that from eighty to ninety per cent. of recoveries are effected in cases of less than a year's duration; while of cases of longer standing the recoveries range from five to fifty per cent., proportioned in most cases to the extent of duration. But in those cases regarded as incurable, there has been, almost without exception, a state of improvement procured by the appropriate treatment, to be accomplished alone in such institutions, most ardently to be desired by every one whose heart is not incapable of feeling sympathy for human suffering. Individuals who have been for years in a state of squalid filth and wretchedness, too horrid to be dwelt on, with all the fury often of the chafed lion, are brought to be attentive to habits of cleanliness and neatness, to be allowed a species of social intercourse with their companions in misfortune, to be capable of manifest enjoyment in amusements, and to perform with good will various kinds of laborin short to a state of comparative comfort and happiness, an accurate conception of which can only be realized by those who have had an opportunity to see them under such circumstances. A few such cases only will be selected from the great number reported.</p><p>Case No. 1.Had been, when brought to the institution, twenty-eight years in prison; seven years he had not felt the influence of fire, and for many nights he had not lain down to sleep at all; he had not been shaved for twenty-eight years, and was constantly provoked and excited by the introduction of hundreds to witness exhibitions of his raving. He is now, (at the date of this report) and has been

<page id="GA1841.1.P255" no="GA1841.1.257" />

for some time, comfortable in health, well clad, keeps his bed and room remarkably clean, and, although very insane on certain subjects, is most of the time pleasant, companionable, and entirely harmless and docile. He shaves himself twice a week, sits at the table with others, takes his meals with propriety, walks about with an attendant, and in every respect enjoys himself as well as his illusions will permit.</p><p>Case 3d.An old man of seventy years of age or more; had been, when brought to the institution, chained for twenty-five years, and had his chain removed but once in that time; has for many months past been very quiet and civil, and behaves like a gentleman; and, although quite insane, keeps his room in good order, and takes his meals at table with seventeen others, with the utmost propriety.</p><p>Case 4th.A female; had been confined so long with a <i>short chain</i> as wholly to lose the use of her lower limbsthis course being considered necessary from her extreme fury; and in this condition she had remained seven years in the institution. Her health has been restored, her limbs rendered again useful, her mind restored, and she has been discharged. She remains with her friends, in the enjoyment of health and reason, and able to labor sufficiently to support herself.</p><p>Case 6th.Was confined closely for seventeen years, before he was removed to the asylum; he was very violent and dangerous, often in chains, although in a strong prison room; he used to scream constantly, and commit acts of violence that required the most rigid restraint. He is now well dressed, civil, and, although often excited, is always respectful and pleasant; is in the habit of assisting the females in washing the floors, drawing water, preparing food, and other domestic offices, and is about the premises without restraint.</p><p>Case 7th.Had been confined, chained in a cage, for years, a most violent and dangerous maniac, naked and filthy; had, on one occasion, when set at liberty, assaulted and killed his brother, and endeavored to kill his sister, but was prevented and secured. He now dresses neatly, is cleanly and civil; mingles freely with sixteen others, and though quite insane, is perfectly harmless.</p><p>Case No. 12.Was in close confinement for six years, and would probably have remained there for life. After being here for six months, he commenced labor, and has not only continued it daily, but takes excellent care of every thing under his hand; he is very pleasant, mild in his feelings, and ready to perform whatever is required of him; he

<page id="GA1841.1.P256" no="GA1841.1.258" />

is trustworthy, and can perform labor without superintendance.</p><p>We have often noticed, says the superintendant, the novel spectacle of two men ploughing in the field alone, both insane, both having committed homicide, and both having been closely confined for a long time.</p><p>Many other cases, equally striking, might be quoted, but the committee are desirous to avoid extending their report beyond what is deemed absolutely necessary to correct information on the subject.</p><p>It is further ascertained, from the above reports, that more than two-thirds of the inmates of the asylum regularly sit down at table and take their meals together, using knife and fork, and rarely any instance occurs of the slightest impropriety in deportment. A larger proportion even attend regularly the services of the chapel, and nothing is seen in their behavior which would distinguish them from an ordinary attentive congregation. In regard to the value and importance of labor in such institutions, the following language is used:</p><p><blockquote><p>The labor performed during the year, in all departments of industry, at the asylum, whether we consider its utility to the individuals employed, or its pecuniary advantages, has never been more successful. No class of our patients are so contented and happy as the laborers; no other convalescents so rapidly or favorably recover. On the farm, in the garden, at works of ornament and improvement, we have a sufficient number of individuals ready at all times to volunteer. So also in every department of domestic labor, and in the workshops. In the winter season we find it difficult to give employment to as many as would be benefited by it; in the spring, the garden and farm open a broader field. The profits of the farm and garden during the last year were $1,887 89.</p></blockquote></p><p>With the view of effecting the humane objects contemplated in the establishment of this institution, your committee have prepared and reported a bill providing for its organization, and would respectfully recommend to the officers to whom the duty of the farther prosecution of the work and government of the institution shall be assigned, the most rigid economy, consistent with the faithful performance of their duty; and we would further suggest, that after the first day of January next, the office of superintendant of the work may be dispensed with, and that no commissioner should be allowed to become a contractor for work or furnishing materials for said institution.
