<p>By the Articles of Confederation of 1778, which was a [Illegible Text] between the states, there was a special reservation of all rights [Illegible Text] sovereignty and independence, not thereby expressly [Illegible Text] which proves conclusively, that prior to [Illegible Text] into that [Illegible Text] all the rights of [Illegible Text] and independence belonged to the states, and were complete in them, and that they did not intend to divest themselves of any of those rights, except such as were expressly delegated.</p><p>In the constitution of 1787, the powers delegated are clearly defined and particularly [Illegible Text] The amendment to the [Illegible Text] is more explicit.

Otherwise, the constitution might be [Illegible Text] with impunity and without redress, as often as the majority [Illegible Text] think proper to [Illegible Text] their powers, and the party [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] to yield a submissive obedience to the measure however [Illegible Text] This would tend to annihilate all the sovereignty and independence of the states, and to consolidate <i>all power</i> in the General Government, which never was desigued nor intended by the [Illegible Text] of the constitution.</p><p>Your committee are also of opinion, that the acts of the General Government in providing for the general welfare, must [Illegible Text] general in their operation and promotive of the general good; not the advancement of the interest of any particular section or local interest, to the injury of another.</p><p>The [Illegible Text] general welfare, implies clearly, that the means [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] this end, must be general in their nature and tendency.

Congress of legitimate powers, that we claim your attentionBut with an ardent hope, founded upon the intelligence, virtue, and love of common country which reigns among the people, of bringing the public servants back to that republican simplicity, in the administration of our affairs which marks, sustains, and adorns our political institutions, and is the only safe guard to liberty. The nature and extent of our political associations cannot be misunderstood by any one who will discard sectional interest, and dispel from his mind the mists and prejudices produced by its deceptive influence.</p><p>That the relation in which we stand towards each other, may be distinctly understood and acknowledged, it is only necessary to review our several situations previous to any political alliance with each other. From our carliest colonization we were of kindred blood, and kindred in principle, and close connexions in pure love of libertyOur primary political connexion had its origin in the oppressions of the mother countryWe resisted aggressions upon our unalienable rights, and with a fervor that thrilled through every heart, joined our fortunes, our lives, and our sacred honor, in the declaration of our independence and the achievement of our liberties.Providence hallowed the undertaking, and victory sealed our [Illegible Text] and each of us was acknowledged a <i>free, independent,</i> and <i>[Illegible Text] State.</i></p><p>To secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, we formed that Constitution, against the provisions of which, no Georgian was ever heard to utter a murmur of complaint. It was by that Constitution we expected to be governed in our relations with foreign governments, and with each other as States, or Independent Communities. The people of Georgia wish neither to deny, or to withdraw any power which they have granted. They love and venerate the Constitution, as they believe a tenacious adherence to it is the only security to the prosperity, the liberties, the glory and the happiness of all the States; and that upon its perpetuation, in its native purity, the principle and progress of free government in the whole world depend. In the legal exercise of the powers conferred in that instrument, there is not a dissenting voice in GeorgiaBut it is the misconstruction and abuse of those powers that is sought to be redressed. The sovereignty of the State Governments was never intended to be given up or impaired, in any other manner than that expressed in the Constitution, and was retained and cautiously guarded, both by the <i>limited</i> and special grants of power in the Constitution, and by the insertion in that instrument of the following articlesThe [Illegible Text] in the Constitution of certain rights, shall not be construed to disparage others retained by the peopleAnd the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. These articles were intended as express limitations to the General Government; and explicit reservations to the State Governments of every power not granted. The language is too plain to fail in expressing the object of the Convention. It cannot then be <i>believed,</i> notwithstanding the warmth and earnestness

<page id="GA1828.1.P178" no="GA1828.1.179" />

with which it has been contended, that the States assented to any power being given to the National Government, but those which were expressed and those which were strictly necessary and proper to carry such expressed powers into effect.</p><p>A system of measures not contemplated by the Constitution, has been adopted and [Illegible Text] pursued by Congress, having for its object the improvement of particular parts of the country, and the advancement of sectional interests. These measures, of whatever kind or character, are justly objectionableas they can only be supported by forced constructions of the Constitution, and are partial and oppressive in their operation; and among them may be included that system, which has been in progress for years, of levying heavy duties to exclude from our ports, many articles of general commerce, for the purpose of encouraging and protecting the manufacturing interest, in exclusion to the other great branches of industry.</p><p>If it were inexpedient only, oppressive and ruinous as it is to our interests, we would not use this method of opposing it. The repeal of the measure would be sought in a different way; but when it is an open and violent infraction of our Compact, we have a right which we will never surrender, to demand its repeal. It is not presumed that you will continue to confide in those who persevere in the exercise of a power which has never been granted themIf it has been granted it is open to public view; there are no secrets in the Constitutionbut for the authority which it confers, the National Government would not exist. Its power is based upon the Constitution alone, and has no auxiliaryWhere then, we may confidently ask you, is the power granted, either expressed or implied, either in letter or spirit, to pass laws to create, extend, and to protect a particular branch of industry, to the prejudice of other interests of equal importance to the people, and of equal advantage to the Nation? It cannot be denied that this is the effect of protecting duties, and that it was intended to be the effect, as prices of all articles upon which duties are paid, are obviously enhanced to the extent of the duty imposed. Is the right claimed by Congress fairly derivable from the power granted to levy taxes, lay imposts, c.? The object to be obtained by this power is very clearIt was to enable the government to raise a revenue to defray expenses, indirect taxes being considered a better mode of raising funds than direct, because they bear most heavily upon those who have not ability to pay them. That power was likewise given to Congress to prevent the injustice which would have resulted to the non-importing States, by paying their indirect taxes into the coffers of importing States, and at the same time through direct taxation upon their people, to furnish their quota of the disbursements of the government. It was not in contemplation of the framers of the Constitution, that a power to raise revenue should be exercised to destroy it. The Convention of Harrisburgh, who met to goad Congress to the late deplorable expedient for the establishment of the monopoly of the manufacturers, knew full well, while recommending an increase of duties, that a decrease

<page id="GA1828.1.P179" no="GA1828.1.180" />

of revenue would be the <i>immediate,</i> and the [Illegible Text] of it, the <i>final</i> result, if their wishes were accomplished; and gave occasion to the subterfuge used in Congress to evade the question of Constitutional power, by rendering it impracticable for the judges of the supreme court to ascertain the true object of the act passed, without looking to the motives of its advocates, which unhappily, as it regards this act, they do not consider themselves authorised to [Illegible Text]</p><p>The Constitution declares that the imposts shall be uniform throughout the United States. That declaration was intended to protect the States from any partiality and advantage which might otherwise have been extended to one quarter of the country, by making the imposts greater at one part than another. What is the difference in effect, if you insist through that power to levy such excessive duties as will give the interest of one part of the community, an advantage over that of another; though that end is not accomplished by imposing greater duties at some ports than at others, yet you desire to attain the same object by their excessive imposition and increase.</p><p>Is the right to protect manufactures, claimed under the power to regulate commerce? It is true Congress has the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian tribes. This power was given to cnable Congress to carry into effect the commercial treaties with foreign nations, and render them [Illegible Text] throughout all the States to save the perplexity which would have arisen by each State retaining the power of making its own commercial regulations with foreign nations, and with the States, which without such a grant of power would not have been effected. That clause was never intended to vest the right, nor can it be legitimately inferred from it, that Congress had the power of legislating upon the internal concerns and interest of the people of the several States. It was only intended to regulate our relations between the whole of the States as one body, and foreign governments, and our commerce with each other as States, or independent communities. If under that grant of power, the right of passing laws for the protection of manufactures can be justified, a continuance of the principle, and an extension of the practice, will lead to the [Illegible Text] extirpation of the very commerce which that clause was inserted to regulate. If it be your interest to lay such interdicting duties as to exclude one article, by the same rule you may exclude another, and go on excluding, until you completely inhibit the importation of every species of foreign manufacture Should you continue to [Illegible Text] the right of excluding all articles which it is your interest to manufacture, you will not, nor cannot deny the same right to other sections of the Union.

is true we cannot at present furnish what is required for the consumption of the nation, and the people will pay higher for these articles of necessity; but give us our own prices long enough, and we shall furnish them much cheaper than they are now afforded, to the great benefit of the country, and the encouragement of American industry.</p><p>Other sections of the country having the same right, would require prohibitory duties upon their favored products or manufactures; and if protection be granted to <i>all,</i> as justice requires it should be, if granted to <i>any,</i> the inference is [Illegible Text] that the commerce with foreign nations, so far as regards their importations, would be at an end; it follows as a necessary consequence, that all foreign commerce would be entirely cut off. Money is the only medium of exchange, and no nation will find it to be her interest to buy our exports, unless we receive theirs in return.</p><p>If the system cannot be justified in the <i>general,</i> upon the <i>principles</i> of our government, it cannot be in <i>part</i>It is not reasoning upon extreme cases, and if it were, it is not an illegitimate test of constitutional principle.</p><p>Whenever a power is exercised by Congress, which is not granted, it is an assumption of authority by that body, dangerous to the liberties of the people, since every assumption of power is an act of despotism.</p><p>The intention and letter of the Constitution, were to prescribe within certain defined limits, the power of the General Government, and not to consolidate the power of the state sovereignties. If the latter was the real government, no matter how arbitrary and partial might be its measures, they would nevertheless be the law, as the majority would rule. But while the Constitution is to regulate the power of Congress, any act which is in contravention of that instrument is illegal, and not binding even though it may have been passed unanimously, and twenty-three out of twenty-four States should assent to it. To provide for the general welfare, is an expression in the Constitution by virtue of which it has been contended, that any law would be constitutional which, in the <i>opinion of Congress,</i> would redound to the general interest. From an inspection of the instrument, this, so far from being a grant of power, is the designation of one <i>object</i> to be effected by powers specially and distinctly granted in the Constitution. The Convention never intended to grant power by this clause; if it had, there would have been no need of any other article in the ConstitutionIf it were [Illegible Text] alone, and received the construction given to it by those who claim unlimited control for the national councils, it would of itself render every article in that instrument nugatoryIndefinite in its extent, it would give, if it gave any thing, unlimited authority. Establish its claim as an authorative article, and it will justify any thing and every thing which Congress might pretend to believe would promote the general welfare.</p>

<p>The interest of one State was never intended to be sacrificed [Illegible Text] that of the othersClimate, soil, and custom, have prescribed different occupations and pursuits suitable to the situation and [Illegible Text] of each other. If it be the interest of any part of the confederacy, to manufacture, let them pursue those vocations in peace to which their genius and circumstances direct them: it is not though expected that they will by legislative enactments, continue to require the agriculturalist to make sacrifices to enhance the products of their labor. Such pretensions are foreign from the spirit of the compact. We have as much right to lay a prohibitory duty upon the hogs, horses, and mules of Kentucky and Ohio, to promote the encouragement of raising those animals, as the General Government has to prohibit foreign goods to promote the manufacture of them in a particular section; or that Kentucky should vote for a duty on bagging to compel us to pay a greater price for the article. The whole [Illegible Text] system is founded in error, and humanity weeps over the fading patriotism of those who sordidly pursue their own interest at the expense and utter sacrifice of the holy principles of liberty and the constitution.</p><p>The people of Georgia are fully sensible of the impositions which are heaped upon them by the extravagant constructions and perversions of the powers delegated to the United States, and regret that they have causes of complaint too well founded to be removed by argument, or to be softened by explanation.

The Constitution was adopted to form a more perfect union, establish justice, [Illegible Text] domestic [Illegible Text], to provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and posterity. Can it be said that the anticipations of our forefathers, who looked to effect these objects by the instrumentality of the Constitution, are realised, when our interests are made subservient to a growing monopolyIs justice established, when we are required not only to buy the products of your labor at your own price, but to suffer by the same compulsory arrangement the loss of a great market, and a depreciation of price for our own? Is it reasonable to expect a more perfect Union, when the interest of a portion of that Union is wholly disregarded, and made the subject of depredation by the other part? Can [Illegible Text] be ensured among a people who are reminded of their injuries and oppressions by repeated infractions of their compacts and [Illegible Text] engagements? Is the general welfare promoted by a studious and systematic course of legislation, which has for its object the promotion and encouragement of a particular branch of industry at the expense of all others? And will the blessings of liberty to ourselves and posterity be secured, if the violence of irritated feelings, and a sense of that misery and degradation which, if the limitations of the Constitution are not more strictly observed, must be our portion, should produce such convulsions as to rend [Illegible Text] twain the Temple of Liberty?</p><p>When we entered the confederacy, it was for the protection of our rights, and we were particularly [Illegible Text] to grant no power by

An object too, which the Constitution intends to effect, by means prescribed, and altogether different from those used. For, under the power to promote the useful arts, an ample and effectual general power, with a prescribed mode of use, resides in Congress to encourage and protect all useful arts. To use another and a different power, capable, indirectly, of effecting such objects, concurrently with that, obviously intended to effect them, is an [Illegible Text] abuse of the [Illegible Text] power.</p><p>3dly.

And every [Illegible Text] of [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] which [Illegible Text] or boundless speculation may produce, will, [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] commercial policy of England [Illegible Text], be sought to be [Illegible Text], by cumulative [Illegible Text] upon foreign commerce.</p><p>It is [Illegible Text] because one species of industry is directly supported by government, at the expense of other branches of industry. The productious of Southern agriculture, which [Illegible Text] have mainly supplied the exportation of this country, and drawn its [Illegible Text] and [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] of manufactured [Illegible Text], are almost <i>forced</i> into domestic markets, and [Illegible Text] within one [Illegible Text].</p><p>A liberal reciprocity of trade, between our own and foreign nations, being by this means destroyed, the vender of [Illegible Text] products is in effect deprived of a choice of markets, either foreign or [Illegible Text], and [Illegible Text] to vend in the latter. Confined to [Illegible Text], [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] dependent on the manufacturing consumer, for the [Illegible Text] of his raw materials. The competition of manufacturers cannot sustain their old prices. And the law operates unequally  oppressively in thisthat the [Illegible Text] is deprived of the liberty of choosing his market. This liberty, hitherto enjoyed, and which has [Illegible Text] been his security, for fair and [Illegible Text] prices of his productions, by [Illegible Text] foreign and domestic competition, is in effect taken awayFor heavy impositions upon foreign imports, exclude foreigners from market, by destroying the equality of [Illegible Text] advantages. Thus, the [Illegible Text] purchaser controls the market. The adventage heretofore enjoyed, by the agriculturalist, is destroyedhe no longer can control his prices by the power of optional disposition, at [Illegible Text] or abroad, but is controlled by purchasers independent in their [Illegible Text] monopolies.</p><p>This [Illegible Text] of an [Illegible Text] right of the [Illegible Text], under the free trade intended by the Constitution, is not, and cannot be compensated by the promised, yet [Illegible Text], [Illegible Text], and improbable advantages [Illegible Text] from [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text]. It is [Illegible Text], because it brings prematurely into existence, those [Illegible Text] whose materials are drawn from the [Illegible Text] of the earth, by imposing duties on the articles manufactured abroad, with a view to prohibit their introduction, and [Illegible Text] the manufacture of the same articles at home. The prices of manufactured imports, are [Illegible Text] regulated by law, to effect an object in its nature partial and sectional. This two, is a [Illegible Text] which operates [Illegible Text]. The consumer is deprived of the [Illegible Text] of seeking a supply of his wants, on equal terms, at home or abroad, at his option. The prices of foreign manufactures, and other commodities, are [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] high, to force the consumer to purchase, what under such restriction can be procured [Illegible Text]; which must be, the domestic manufacture. Here the manufacturer is the favorite of governmentlegislation directly confers upon him [Illegible Text] advantageswhile the [Illegible Text] pays him [Illegible Text], and is in dependence upon him.</p><p>It might be assuming too [Illegible Text] a ground, to say that the Constitution [Illegible Text] the [Illegible Text] and protection of any object of

industrythat it forbids the protection of any manufacture whatever. It is both advisable and patriotic, that all the necessaries and implements of military use, in protecting and defending our rights, and our honor as a nation, should be the product of national industry. To provide for the common defence and general welfare, is a power clearly given to the Congress. The power given is vague, and if taken separate, indefinite, but when taken in connexion with the [Illegible Text] and even jealous imitations of federal powers, and considered in reference to the specified general objects of our confederation, it cannot be deemed to be a power, limitable only by the discretion of a majority of Congress. Does not Congress provide for the common defence and general welfare, in erecting fortifications? Is the general welfare something distinct from, and separable from, the common defence? And if so, what class of objects and measures can be enumerated under it? The power to provide for the general welfare certainly confers not a discretionary power over every object of human legislation. It refers to appropriations of money, for proposed objects, included within the enumerated federal powers. Whether any proposed measure, or regulation, will promote the general welfare, is one question entirely speculative. [Illegible Text] legislative action upon such measure, is within the limit of constitutional competency, or whether its object be constitutionally pursued, is another question. Measures of an experimental character, and of problematical operation, upon the general good, transcend the prudent restraints, and violate the spirit of the Constitution. To guard it from violation, is the proper object of State vigilance: to restore its purity, a proper and legitimate object of their several or united endeavors.</p><p>The spirit and objects of the Federal Compact, place a virtual constraint upon latitudinary construction and implication. The power is clearly limited by its objects. We object, therefore, to the expansion of federal powers by construction. We deny the right of Congress to restrain the freedom of our commerce, to protect, as it is said, domestic [Illegible Text];and we affirm, that a power wisely given to Congress, is carried to an extent, at once unuecessary, inexpedient, and even abusive.</p><p>[Illegible Text] The late tariff altering the duties on imports, if the power of the Constitution were strictly adhered to, would be a revenue bill. It is calculated to diminish the revenue. In this, the law is inexpedient and injudicious. But the avowed object of the law is to promote manufactures at home. Under the power therefore to raise a revenue, for specific national purposes, a different object is pursued. In this the power is perverted. If the law be called a regulation of commerce, it is, in like manner, inexpedient and oppressive.</p><p>If the law in question, upon its face, promised a greater prosperity to our external commerce, which the Constitution intended to preserve and extend by wise regulations, we should deem the power to regulate it, faithfully fulfilled and executed. But on its very face, the features of [Illegible Text] are set forth in full relief. And a short [Illegible Text]

<page id="GA1828.1.P186" no="GA1828.1.187" />

has realised the consequences which its provisions indicated. [Illegible Text] the law, in this light, calculated to produce its legitimate object? If experience of the contrary, proves not merely its inefficiency, but its [Illegible Text] operation, policy on the first ground requires; justice, expediency and necessity demand it on the second. If the decline and ruin of our commerce, is the consequence of an attempt to regulate it, the consequence proves the measure to have been injudicious, either in conception or [Illegible Text] Either would be a sufficient ground of repeal. If under the pretext of regulating commerce, or of raising a revenue, the aim is, to effect a collateral and indirect object; if a [Illegible Text] power be used in disguise, to accomplish a purpose, which, if the power and right to accomplish it, existed, could be [Illegible Text] by a direct, overt, and undisguised exercise of the power;then, and in the first case, the legitimate power is abused and perverted; and in the second case, the stratagem resorted to, argues the [Illegible Text] of using improperly, a proper power, and a disregard of the restraints and limitations of the powers of the Constitution. This spirit is censurable, and calculated, to impair the vigour of the [Illegible Text] and vitiate the purity of federal legislation; it leads to the use of unconstitutional powers; it leads to illiberal and sectional legislation; and produces a disregard or oblivion of national interests.</p><p>While complaining of a law intended solely to promote sectional objects, we will endeavor to avoid an opposition upon sectional interests and feelings. We are aware, that if each state consulted its [Illegible Text] interests alone, the consequences might be particularly disagreeable and injurious to others; so too, if [Illegible Text] section of the Union acted on the same illiberal principle. It might be impracticable in the Federal Government of these states to [Illegible Text] all rights of independent sovereignty to each, and all the particular intersts of an individual state, or section of states, to their fullest extent, and [Illegible Text] provide for the interest and safety of all. To reconcile all to federal legislation, partial and conciliatory compromises of sectional interest must be made Individuals entering into society must give up a share of liberty to preserve the rest. This is the rational and harmonizing spirit, and doctrine of law. It is strongly applicable to these states, confederated for the great purposes of general defence, general benefit, and general harmony. For the advantages and benefits of union, the interest of particular states, or divisions of states, should be in some measure compromised; that a spirit of liberal and fraternal conciliation should regulate all measures intended to advance their [Illegible Text] prosperity. Thus, if it be the interest of the Middle and Western divisions of the Union, to manufacture, their interest should not be promoted by making [Illegible Text] agricultural divisions of the Union tributary to them.</p><p>The population of the first divisions, which secures to them a numerical predominance in the federal councils, enables them to [Illegible Text] the measures of legislation to their particular benefit. It is true that the political will of the Union, (if a majority of members on the floor of Congress, be considered a fair representative of the will of the Union.) was in the Congress which [Illegible Text] the tariff, clearly in

its favor. Are we told that we must submit to the will of the [Illegible Text] We reply, that while we admit the general propriety of [Illegible Text] to that [Illegible Text] does it [Illegible Text] that we are to observe the doctrincs of passive [Illegible Text] and non-resistance? That would preclude the [Illegible Text] right of [Illegible Text] But such sentiments are not the [Illegible Text] growth of freedom and republicanism. Besides the ability to use a power, does [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] imply the expediency of using it; on the contrary, where the difference between a majority and a [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] is small; where opinions and feelings on subjects, are almost in [Illegible Text] reason and prudence require that a [Illegible Text] party should use its power with [Illegible Text] and caution. This should especially be the case with the States of this Union. Under our Federal [Illegible Text] Congress is made the depository of certain powers, [Illegible Text] up by the States severally, for general objects; objects which [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] to the Union, may be called national, in contradistinction to [Illegible Text] objects. [Illegible Text] arising from, and [Illegible Text] by a housand [Illegible Text] and [Illegible Text] of revolutionary [Illegible Text] presided at this [Illegible Text] of compromise and [Illegible Text] It becomes us to recur to this [Illegible Text] to catch from the records and events of those times, the spirit which [Illegible Text] their political agents; to carry this spirit with us into the councils which act upon the interests of the nation. Those who look not back to their [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] look forward to [Illegible Text] the present [Illegible Text] their conceptions, and the future and the [Illegible Text] are alike [Illegible Text] to them. When the past is thus considered, the wise and judicious will doubt and [Illegible Text] to exercise a power, or [Illegible Text] a measure, [Illegible Text] of the interest of, and therefore, offensive to a large minority of the Union.</p><p>But to reconcile the Southern divisions of the Union, averse to changing its [Illegible Text] the fruits of which have hitherto been profitably exchanged, for the various commodities of foreign nations; to reconcile New England to the [Illegible Text] of her boundless carrying tradethe former is promised an eager market, and a fair price for the products of their soilthe latter is [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] employment, in exporting the rich and various manufactures of the United States.

are the [Illegible Text] used to soothe an indignation, aroused by the rigorous and oppressive exercise of power; a power distorted and perverted. We decline a repetition of the powerful expositions made against the first assumption. The price of a manufactured article is made up of three components1st. The price of the raw material2d. The wages of labor3d. The profits of capital.The powerful expositions which have gone forth to the world, show the futility of the first assumption. The other assumptions are entitled to as much credit as the first.</p><p>The present Tariff is calculated to diminish our revenue. If the course of policy, [Illegible Text] in [Illegible Text] the imposts on all imports, be fully effectuated; and the domestic manufactures supercede those hitherto importedin which process, our external commerce will be dwindling away, and with it, our revenue, the question arises, what will be the resort, to raise a revenue? Direct taxation. We deprecate the time when this will take place; when the citizens of the different States will be called on to support, by direct taxes, not only their particular State, but also the Federal Government. Patriotism will cheerfully submit to onerous exactions, to sustain the government in exigency and perilBut it will feel with indignation the weight of any imposition, which sectional power, influenced by the illiberality of sectional interests, may impose. It will feel with regret, [Illegible Text] with a proud contempt, a faithless departure from the letter and spirit of a compact, formed with the fondest hope of its perpetuity; and [Illegible Text] until recently, cherished and adhered to with an exalted and [Illegible Text] reverence. Taxation is a power, which to avoid offence requires a delicate use and execution. An indirect, [Illegible Text] and therefore, inoppressive mode, is preferable to any direct taxation. When the tax of an article, or item of property is disguised and concealed by its pricewhich in relation to the [Illegible Text] itself is considered its fair equivalentthe tax is paid, and is not felt. It falls almost insensibly upon the consumer. And mankind in this way, will pay with no [Illegible Text] a sum of taxation, which if demanded of them as a tax, <i>co nomine,</i> and in cash, they would reluctantly hand forth. The payment of two specific taxes, for two specific objects, would be throughout the States disagreeable, and would seem and fuel oppressive; however constitutional and proper it would be [Illegible Text] national necessity. But the [Illegible Text] of a course of policy by the Federal Government, which would render this resort, always necessary for its support, is a course we feel opposed to, and will perseveringly and decisively resist. To this result the tariff policy, with its avowed object, tendsto that as the instrument of effecting it, we will yield a full and steady tribute of opposition.The exports of Southern production, have, and still constitute, the chief mean of exchange for all articles brought from the abounding stores of British industry. The [Illegible Text] intending to promote domestic manufactures by almost prohibiting this exchange, intends to force Southern products into Northern markets. By this, the agricultural and mercantile interests are oppressed. Is not the tendency to restrain and diminish foreign commerce? Does it not abuse and pervert the power, to raise a revenue, as well as the power to regulate commerce?</p>

<page id="GA1828.1.P189" no="GA1828.1.190" />

<p>Congress has power to promote the useful artsAmong [Illegible Text] certainly the arts of manufacture and the art of agriculture. How? By <i>forcing</i> the fruits of agricultural industry into one channel, and into one market? By <i>forcing</i> them to contribute to manufactures? And thus in effect giving bounties to manufactures, to stimulate their activity and their enterprise? No: But by securing to the inventors of improvements, in the useful arts, the benefits of their inventions and their discoveries. Household industry supplies the immediate wants of familiestheir food and their raiment. Advancing one step further, an individual for gain, and the convenience of a neighborhood, may manufacture, to supply for equivalent compensation, the wants of a population around. Thus the progress is spontaneous and natural. The progress of their increase and diffusion throughout a country, is alike natural, and proceeds upon the common principles of necessity, convenience, profit, and ability; as these are developed amidst an increasing and improving population, daily and yearly acquiring a thousand artificial and refined wants. Manufactories, which supply the various conveniences and elegancies, which refinement or luxury, either require or crave, will naturally spring up by the enterprise and cupidity of individuals. They will be resorted to as a profitable, or supporting species of labour, by thousands; and will be seen to increase and prosper, according to the amount of the wants and demands of population.</p><p>The greatest stimulant to the improvement and extension of the useful arts, exists in the power resident in the Federal Government, to appropriate to individual genius and skill, the benefit of its inventions and discoveries. The Federal Convention, sagaciously foreseeing this natural progression of improvements, wisely withheld from Congress, the power to promote them by additional protecting laws. By this power the same rewards are held forth to active and inventive genius, throughout the Union. What further power could have been necessary? Can Congress incorporate a company of manufacturers, in any one of the States? It connotIf a power of protection, other than that specified, to promote the useful arts, was intended to be given by the Constitution, to Congress, why was it not given in some direct, positive, indisputable form? But an express refusal to give such a specific power, is recorded on the journals of the Convention! And the power of granting pstent rights, for inventions and discoveries substituted as more expedient. A power highly remunerative and incapable of oppressing.</p><p>A tariff for raising a revenue, is constitutional and necessary.Further than this, no object was intended by the power. The legislative power of the several States is the proper power to promote manufactures, by incorporating companies. Such is the common mode of concentrating the wealth of individuals, and rendering it when thus united, competent to do, what individuals could not effect. Such too, are voluntary associations, formed with the hope, or the certainty of particular advantages; and as such, their efforts may be considered as private enterprises. Thus, there exist two proper

<page id="GA1828.1.P190" no="GA1828.1.191" />

depositories of powers, capable of producing the same effects, by two different modes. The Federal Power, specified in the Constitution, (Art. 1st. Sec. 8) to promote the useful artsand the State power of incorporating companies, or giving exclusive privileges for any specific objects, promotive of its internal prosperity:for example, manufacturing companies, when circumstances hold forth to a combination of indviiduals, the prospect of profitable exertions. These powers, are too, in strict concurrence. A judicious and necessary tariff may, collaterally, stimulate domestic industryarouse activityand inspirit speculation. Such results may often succeed upon a truly revenue regulation; and the fact of their following proves the regulation to be judicious. But what are we to say of a tariff which prostrates commerce? Which operates so oppressively on the fair and honorable enterprise of merchants, as to produce the same effects as a law, to promote smuggling? We must condemn it as injudiciousAnd when we consider the law to have been enacted to encourage domestic manufactures, we must condemn it as unconstitutional. FurtherIf such a power was intended to reside in Congress, other than that expressly given, why did the Constitution expressly forbid the imposition of duties on exports? Does not the exemption intend, and in fact, promote an absolute freedom of trade? Yet, the present tariff policy, intends by a reverse operation, to defeat the effect of that exemption.</p><p>England promoted her Woollen Manufactures by inhibiting the exportation of wool. To promote manufactures, she pursued a course the opposite of the American System. Yet the English plan is that, which would directly promote the objects of the American System. This plan cannot be pursuedit is forbid by the Constitution. Yet such, if the Constitution had intended it, would have been the power given, to legislate the country into manufacturing townsProhibiting the exportation of raw materials, would have induced the necessity of manufacturing. Thus the country might have become an inexhaustible supply for the wants of the commercial world.</p><p>One section of the Union may be destined by its physical circumstances, mainly to pursue manufacturing. If so, the rapid progression of every thing, amidst lively and unfettered enterprise, will early develope that destiny. It will be sustained by circumstances more powerful and permanent than legislation. Amid the rival industry of sister states, absolutely free in their social and commercial intercourse, what is mutually advantageous will be developed with insensible rapiditywhen thus made known interest will lead to their enjoyment. Proceeding thus, a Federal and Domestic Legislation, liable to the natural bias of sectional interest, and therefore to abuse and partial oppression, being abandoned, the geographical delineation and fosterage of particular interests, will produce no heart-burnings among the several divisions of our Union.</p><p>We, therefore, recommend to our sister States opposed to the recent Tariff law, solemnly to protest to the Senate of the U. States against that [Illegible Text] lawto deprecato the abuse of limited powers,

By reference to the treaty of eighth July, eighteen hundred and seventeen, between the Cherokees and the General Government, it is also ascertained, that said tribe ceded by said treaty, a portion of their lands lying north of said line and east of the Chattahoochie; from which it would clearly appear, that as late as eighteen hundred and eighteen, the Suwanne Old Town on the Chattahoochie, was the point on said river to which the boundaries of the Creeks and Cherokees extendedthe one having ceded lands north and the other south of that point.</p><p>By reference to the other treaties with said tribes, entered into by the United States, it appears that the mouth of Wills' creek on the Coosa river, was the established point of boundary between said

<page id="GA1828.1.P208" no="GA1828.1.209" />

[Illegible Text] on that river. The most rational conclusion from these facts is that the established boundary between said tribes west of the Chattahoochie, was a line connecting the two points above designated, viz: the Suwanne Old Town on the Chattahoochie, and the mouth of Wills' creek on the Coosa river. In confirmation of this conclusion, your committee have received information from General D. B. Mitchell, former Creek Agent, that a boundary had been established between said tribes, running from Suwanne Old Town as aforesaid, immediately across to the Hightower river at a place called Sixes' Old Town; thence down said river to the mouth of Wills' creekthat such boundary was agreed upon and established between said tribes, by a convention or treaty held many years ago, to which the United States was a party, and which was [Illegible Text] and recognised by the General Government as the permanent boundary line between said tribes, your committee are confident, from all the information which they have received, that the fact is susceptible of proof; not only from the report made to the General Government by Col. Hawkins, formerly Indian Agent, but by the testimony of living witnesses, that such was the established boundary of said tribes, between said rivers Coosa and Chattahoochie, and the only one ever recognised and ratified by the Government of the United States.</p><p>Your committee are aware of the fact, that by a subsequent agreement or convention between said tribes in eighteen hundred and twenty-one, another and a different boundary was attempted to be established, running from the Buzzard Roost on the Chattahoochie in a straight line to the mouth of Wills' creek. But this line was agreed upon and run by the Indians themselves, without the assent or authority of the General GovernmentThe United States was no party to such agreement, nor have your committee understood that it has been recognised or ratified by the General Governmentit is therefore void. The Creek tribe had no right, according to the Constitution of the United States and the laws of Congress, to cede any portion of its territory to the Cherokees, by any agreement, reaty or negotiation, to which the United States was not a party.The convention of eighteen hundred and twenty-one, between said tribes, being thus clearly and unquestionably null and void, the whole of the territory lying south of the long established and permanent boundary between said tribes first above described, and east of the Alabama line, is now the rightful property of Georgia; for by the treaty of fifteenth November, eighteen hundred and twenty-seven, made by the Creeks with the United States, all the lands owned or claimed by the Creek Nation of Indians, not theretofore ceded, and which on actual survey should be found to be within the chartered limits of Georgia, were ceded to the United States for the use of Georgia. It is a fact admitted on all hands, and well ascertained, that the territory thus described, does lie within the chartered limits of Georgia.

<law id="R1828V1N181" initial.page="211"><p>IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, December 16, 1828.</p><p>The Joint Committee on the State of the Republic, to whom was referred that part of the Governor's communication, which relates to the dividing line between Georgia and the Territory of Florida, have had the same under consideration, together with the accompanying documentand after an attentive examination of the subject<b>REPORT:</b></p><p>That the Executive conformably to a resolution of the last session caused the report then made, to be land before [Illegible Text] and in further compliance with the request of the legislature, opened a correspondence with the President of the United States, in which the claims of Georgia to her legitimate and constitutional boundary were zealously and ably asserted. The report made to the Senate of the United States, by the judiciary committee, recommended the postponement of the subject, [Illegible Text] the ensuing session. That to the House of Representives was drawn to [Illegible Text] more definite [Illegible Text] by resolving as the opinion of the committee that in runing the boundary line between Georgia and Florida, the point designated by the commissioners under the third article of the treaty of 1795, between the United States and Spain, [Illegible Text] to be the [Illegible Text] of the line from the junction of the Chattahoochee and Flint rivers. This report was not acted upon: the subject consequently is yet to be discussed and decided. Your committee reposing full confidence in the General Government, and deeply sensible of the inviolability of Georgia's claim, cannot but express their [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] that the committee should upon the evidence before it, have [Illegible Text] to recommend the repeal of the act of Congress of eighteen hundred and twenty-six, or such a modification of it as would have enabled the President to empower Commissioners, in conjunction with this government, to run and mark the [Illegible Text] agreeable to the rights of the parties. And still more are they [Illegible Text] that reasons should have been sought after, and [Illegible Text] employed, on which no just inference against our claim [Illegible Text] be sustained. The whole argument used by the committee charged with this matter has for its foundation, and arises out of the [Illegible Text] Mr. Ellicot and the Spanish Commissioner, in designating the North branch as the true source of the [Illegible Text] Marys. This mistake is the key-stone of the whole [Illegible Text] it is from this that they say the North prong was called St. Marys, and ought to be so considered; it is this that led them into the error of declaring that the commissioners of the two governments were appointed to settle and decide a contested question of boundary, and because this mistake was not detected before the line was about to be run, the [Illegible Text] of Georgia is presumed and urged as an argument against her claim.</p><p>It is a fact admitted by all parties, and which forms the very essence of this controversy, that the line between the Chattahoochee and Flint rivers, and the head of St. Marys river, was neither traced [Illegible Text] marked by the commissioners appointed under third article of the treaty with Spain. From that article they derived their powers, and by a reference to [Illegible Text] it will appear that they were not [Illegible Text] but merely ministeral agents acting under orders, to run

<page id="GA1828.1.P211" no="GA1828.1.212" />

and mark the line according to the stipulations of the second article of the treaty, which is in the following wordsThe Southern boundary of the United States, which divides their territory from the Spanish Colonies of East and West Florida, shall be designated by a line beginning on the river Mississippi, at the northernmost part of the thirty-first degree of latitude North of the equator, which from thence shall be drawn East to the middle of the river Apalachicola or Chattahoochee; thence along the middle thereof to its junction with the Flint; thence straight to the head of St. Marys river, and thence down the middle thereof to the Atlantic Ocean. From the Mississippi to the Chattahoochee they executed their commission according to the stipulations of the treaty. The remaining part of the duty assigned them, they neglected to perform; and whatever agreement they may have made by virtue of the powers invested in the third article, cannot be reasonably insisted upon as authority for varying the true line: as the article in its most enlarged construction does not extend so far as to justify the running of the line in any other direction, or from and to any other points, than those designated in the second article. The point of departure and the terminating point are both fixed by the second article, and it is provided in the third, specially, that the commissioners should run  mark from and to those points. The points referred to are, from the junction of the Chatahoochee and Flint rivers, [Illegible Text] the head of the St. Marys river; and not to mound A or mound B, or to any other indefinite place to be fixed upon at the commissioners discretion. As the proceedings of those Commissioners, present the only difficulty, your committee [Illegible Text] leave cite the whole article under which they acted, to wit; In order to carry the [Illegible Text] article into effect, one commissioner and one surveyor shall be appointed by each of the contracting parties, who shall meet at the Natches, on the left side of the river Mississippi, before the expiration of six months from the ratification of this convention; and they shall proceed to run and mark this boundary according to the stipulations of said article; they shall make plats, and keep journals of the proceedings, which shall be considered as part of this convention, and shall have the same force as if they were inserted therein. It is [Illegible Text] to presume that the [Illegible Text] committee did not examine minutely the provisions of this article, or they would not have exposed their judgment to impeachment by asserting that the commissioners of the two governments were appointed <i>to settle and decide a contested question of boundary.</i></p><p>There is no discretion conferred in this article. If their plats and journals were to have the same force as the convention, they were nevertheless obliged to be in [Illegible Text] with its stipulation. If, therefore, Mr. Elicott agreed, as is insisted upon, that one mile north of mound B. should be as far south as the line when run should approach, it is very palpable that he exceeded his authority, even though he may have made a plat of mound B and journalised the agreement, He was not sent there to make an agreement defining a point to which the line should be run at some future time; but to

<page id="GA1828.1.P212" no="GA1828.1.213" />

run and mark the line between points already described. If permitted to vary the stipulation of the treaty, he could with as much propriety and equal justice, have fixed upon a point fifty miles further in the interior of Georgia. The question is, did the Spanish and American commissioners run and mark the line from the junction of the Chattahoochee and Flint rivers to the head of the St. Marys river, as they were directed to do? No: they ran no line at all between those points! What did they do? They agreed that the line should be run at some future time, and by some other persons, to a certain other point different from that fixed by the treaty!!! The committee who have claimed this extraordinary power for the commissioners, place themselves in an inextricable dilemma, as they not only consider themselves authorised to overturn the treaty they were appointed to [Illegible Text] into effect; but likewise, assume <i>for them the right</i> to bargain away the soil and sovereignty of a sovereign State, who could not under her obligations to the Union, interfere in settling the boundaries of the United States, though on that line of it she was more immediately concerned than all her sister states together. So far from those commissioners being justified in the exercise of the power which they arrogated, your committee, next to the loss of the liberties of their [Illegible Text] State, would regret to see the time, when the government of the United States should become so forgetful of the limitations of her prerogatives, as to assume the power of ratifying a treaty with any foreign nation, by which the least portion of the soil of a state should be taken from her without her consent.</p><p>The United States is bound by the Constitution to protect us from invasion. Upon the supposition then, that the line had been run and marked agreeable to the report of the Spanish commissioners, and had been sanctioned by the government, by a ratification of the [Illegible Text] it would have imposed upon her the disagreeable alternative of breaking the treaty with Spain, or, abandoning her obligations to the confederacy. If Florida were yet a Spanish Province, Georgia would have a right to require the United States to perform her sacred engagements, by driving from our soil the Spaniard who invaded it. <i>To provide for the common defence,</i> is one of the principal objects of our political association; and could the United States humiliate themselves upon our application to have our soil and our sovereignty restored to us, by plending that they had ceded it to Spain, and therefore could not interfere? Such disregard of her obligations would be productive of the worst of consequences, as it would destroy all confidence in the protection of the Constitution. It is not expected, now that the Federal Government is the proprietor of Florida, that it can be unmindful of the declaration in the Constitution, that no new state shall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any states, or parts of states, without the consent of the legislatures of the state concerned. Has the legislature of Georgia ever given her assent in any manner, that, that portion of the state should be detached and set apart to assist in [Illegible Text] formation of another State? The forgoing allusion to the obligations of the General Government to the States, we have thought it

<page id="GA1828.1.P213" no="GA1828.1.214" />

advisable to make, because it does not appear from the report made to the House of Representatives, that the ommittee themselves consider Ellicott's moand to be the head of St. Marys, but they say it `ought to be so considered, because Elicott and the Spanish commissioner agreed that it should be so, and that the Georgia commisers in 1818, [Illegible Text] in the designation; from which [Illegible Text] it had the reputation of being the head of St. Marys; and because of that reputation, it should be considered the true bead or source of the St. Marys. This though not precisely their language, is the amount of their argument. Your committee conceiving that they have most conclusively proven that the American and Spanish commissioners to have acted extraofficically in making mounds and agreements not provided for by the treaty, any reputation of names inferred from those acts, is too vague to require serious examination.</p><p>In regard to the acquiescence of Georgia the facts cited in the report to Congress, prove that the authorities of the State were deceived. If Georgia had considered the act of the United States and Spain as decisive and final, she would not have deputed commissioners to have made an examination. The very deputation shows that she conceived, as must be admitted, that she had a right to be heard in settling her own boundary. She did not though send those commissioners to make a final settlement of her boundary. She could only confer such power when the United States was ready to join her in the commission. They were sent merely upon an exploring tour, for the satisfaction of the State, on a disputed point. The United States were under no obligation to abide by the opinion formed. How then can the United States upon any principle of reciprocity contend that Georgia should be forstalled by an opinion as to an isolated fact, to which they held themselves free to agree or [Illegible Text] The [Illegible Text] of Georgia in the extent to which it has been given, only proves that she was then, as she is now, and ever will be, while she respects the right of others as she does her own, willing to be governed in the running of that line by the true [Illegible Text] She desired then no more than she believed to be her right; and from the evidence then in her possession, she supposed the point fixid upon by Ellicott, was the true point. She contends now for no more than later developments incontestibly prove to be her own.</p><p>Your committee feel authorised by the facts, to deny that Georgia has ever acquiesced so far as to agree that the line should be run to Ellicott's mound; there has been no definite act of the State by which the matter has been settled, or considered settled, by either party. It is true her commissioners believed that the mound was at the source of the river, upon whose information the Governor's opinion was then predicated, all of which was mainly [Illegible Text] to the confidence reposed in the previous examinations of Mr. Ellicott. They were not, however, associated with commissioners of the United States to settle the boundary; they were [Illegible Text] merely exparte in the search of information, whose [Illegible Text] of correct, would not have bound the United States, and if [Illegible Text] cannot hind Georgia: neither this [Illegible Text] any other act coucludes

<page id="GA1828.1.P214" no="GA1828.1.215" />

either party, because the parties never have acted in conjunction, consequenutly the true head of the St. Marys has always been debatable, and from the limited information as to the topography of the country, it was obliged to remain so, until commmissioners were duly appointed by the parties to run and mark the line. The argument of the committee, that the North prong was called the St. Marys, and therefore intended in the several state papers above recited, to which they attach the greatest importance, is based upon the same mistake of their own agent; for from the evidence adduced by them, it appears that Ellicott was the first who gave it the name of St. Marys, in exclusion of the other branches; and by an assumption of their own, they deprive the Southern branch of a participation in the rights of a name. This argument cannot avail even upon the principle which they were forced to admit in their illustration, until a name for the South prong, different from St. Marys shall have been established, and that too known to the, King of Great Britain, when the boundary of Georgia was described; as it is clear by the commission to Governor Wright, that it was intended by the Royal Government to extend the Eastern boundary of Georgia to the most <i>Southern stream</i> of St., Marys, and thence to the head thereof. The river took is name at the disemboguementof course, all streams coming in on the South were [Illegible Text] streams of that river, to the head of the most Southern stream, is the point at which the Eastern line [Illegible Text] for it is in a subsequent clause that the Southern [Illegible Text] is described to be thence Westward as far as our [Illegible Text] extend by the North boundary line of our Provinces of [Illegible Text] and West Florida.</p><p>By this commission, all previous boundaries of Georgia were revoked and determined. To this then, we are to look for our geographical limits, and fortunately for us in this exigency, it describes that stream of the St. Marys to be, the head or source for which we are now contending, with an accuracy that can no longer be misunderstod. It is probable that the course of the river was not accurately known; from which it is inferred, that it was the intention of the Royal Commission that Georgia should extend as far South as the <i>most Southern stream,</i> and to the head thereof, or that part of the description would not have been incorporated in the Eeastern boundary. It is reasonable to believe that this identical stream was meant, and not the stream at the disemboguement, which was between Amelia Island and the main, which is one of the months of the St. Marys. It could not have applied to that, as both the Provinces of Georgia and Florida were at that time under the same regal government and Ameha was not than, nor has it at any time since been considered as belonging to Georgia. If then it did not mean the Southern stream at the mouth of the river, it must have [Illegible Text] the Southern stream higher up the river. It is from this charter that our Legislature conceived themselves authorised in 1783, to declare our boundary to be from the fork of the [Illegible Text] where the [Illegible Text] and [Illegible Text] rivers [Illegible Text] in a direct line, to the [Illegible Text] or source of the <i>Southernmost stream</i> of the St. Marys, river, and along the course of said river to the Atlantic Ocean.

<page id="GA1828.1.P215" no="GA1828.1.216" />

Which furnishes additional evidence that the South prong was known at that day, to be the head of the river. If the Southern stream were not ascertained to lead to the source of the river, there would be more plausibility in the entertainment of different opinions upon the subject: as in that event, the boundary acknowledged by Great Britain in the treaty of '82, and provided for us by the treaty with Spain in '95 would vary from that described by the regal commission of '64, and our act of '83But when all these documents agree that the head of the St. Marys is one of the points by which the boundary was to be regulated, and the rights conveyed in the charter of Florida are not violateddoes it not require a tenacity of opinion, approaching obstinacy in error, to insist upon a deviation? It is not expected that Congress will be led by [Illegible Text] to the support of an erroneous claim. These questions, then, resultIf the line were to be run to the point agreed upon by the commissioners, under the 3d article of the treaty with Spain, would it run according to the boundary described for us in our old Charter? According to the boundary which is secured to us in the definitive treaty of peace with Great Britain? Which is provided for us in the treaty [Illegible Text] '95, with the Spanish Government? which our act of '83 recognises? And more than all, which our Constitution consecrates.</p><p>Your Committee cannot believe that when the subject is fully investigated by Congress, that the [Illegible Text] government will be so unmindful of justice and her obligations to one of the confederacy, even upon the hypothesis that she could [Illegible Text] as to claim an advantage which is derived solely from the [Illegible Text] and error of her own agent.

All reports as well as the omission to make them go to shew, that the Commissioners and those entrusted with this business, have not [Illegible Text] that fidelity, industry and skill, which the State has a right to expect they would do. It is

<page id="GA1828.1.P219" no="GA1828.1.220" />

true, that the attention of the State has been but recently [Illegible Text] to the subject of Internal Improvement, and success in that business must depend in a great measure, upon the experience of those who control it; and to this may be attributed in part, the little profit which the State has reaped, and after having expended so much of its treasure. Your Committee do not consider that they have cause to censure the Chief Civil Engineer for the manner in which he has discharged his duty. His reputation in North-Carolina as well as in England as an Engineer, is doubtless just, and his failure to succeed in Georgia, if indeed failure can be charged to him, is more attributable to the course he has been directed to take, than to any want of skill in the performance of his operations.</p><p>Your Committee consider, that the amount of money already [Illegible Text] out on Internal Improvements, if properly applied, would have been abundantly sufficient to render navigable the first class of rivers in the State; but it has been unfortunately the case, that whenever an appropriation has been made, the amount has been divided into so many parts, and applied to the use of so many different places, unaided by professional experience and science, that there has no benefit accrued to any section of the State.</p><p>If the sum of $325,000 had been applied to benefiting the condition of roads, the people of the State would doubtless have realised a much greater profit than they have from the improvement in the navigation of rivers.</p><p>The high tuition which the State has already paid for the experience which she possesses on this subject, together with the advanced period of this session of the legislature, induces your committe respectfully to submit the following resolution:</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That no further appropriations be made for the purposes of Internal Improvement, until some better and more efficient system shall be matured and adopted, and that the office of Givil Engineer be abolished for the present.</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That his Excellency the Governor be requested to discharge the Civil Engineer, Hamilton Fulton, from the service of this State, so soon as the present quarter, specified by his Excellency's Message of the 4th inst. shall have expired.</p><approvaldate>Approved Dec. 20, 1828.</approvaldate></law>

Recent indications exhibited in South-Carolina, evidence very clearly, not only the unwillingness but the inability of [Illegible Text] State to aid in the consummation of the proposed undertaking.</p><p>The Governor of South-Carolina, in a letter addressed to the Executive of this State, frankly admits, that the incorporation of a Company to erect a rail road from Hamburg to the city of Charleston, which it seems will be carried into effect, will render this State averse to expending any money on the river below Augusta In another part of the same letter he says, it is not likely that in any short time this State will make any appropriation for clearing the river above Augusta; in favor of this course we have one unanswerable argument, the low state of our treasury. This confession impresses your committee with the belief, that should the complete ratification of the convention be obtained, it would under existing circumstances, be inoperative or of no avail. Georgia, we apprehend, would be unwilling to fetter herself by a positive pledge, when there was a strong probability, if not absolute certainty, that all the disbursements necessary to effectuate the proposed object, were to [Illegible Text] exclusively from her own treasury. Should however, the resource of the other contracting party, ever ever enable her to co-operate

with us in the prosecution of the work, a collision of opinion, engendered by a diversity of interests, would unquestionably prevailin regard to the portion of the river upon which the joint fund should be expended. It would be a paramount consideration with Georgia, to render perfect the navigation of the river below Augusta, whilst South-Carolina with all the facilities for transportation, afforded by her rail road, could feel no interest whatever in its improvement. She would of course, bestow all her care and attention upon the river above Augusta, which to us would be an object of secondary importance. These considerations impell your committee to recommend for adoption, the following resolution:</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That under present circumstances, it is impolitic on the part of Georgia, to attempt to procure a full and entire ratification of the Convention with South-Carolina, relative to the navigation of the Savannah and Tugalo rivers.</p><approvaldate>Approved; December 20, 1828.</approvaldate></law><law id="R1828V1N222" initial.page="240"><p>IN SENATE, December 4, 1828.</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That the execution of the State against John A.

Secondly,

that Alabama had neither given her assent, or expressed a desire for the interposition of the United States, and without such assent or such desire, any act done would be nugatory, invalid, and void. A sensitiveness for the rights of the States, and a fear of invading them, appeared to restrain the exercise of a power, which would not have been deemed illegitimate, or even contested by either of the States interested. To the proper understanding of the disagreement in respect to boundary, and to present in its true light the arguments used by the Commissioners in 1826, we must refer to the first Article of Cession of 1802, between Georgia and the United States. She cedes all her title to the jurisdiction and soil within the United States south of the State of Tennessee, and west of a line beginning on the western bank of the [Illegible Text], where it crosses the boundary line between the United States and Spaing running thence up said river Chattahoochie and along its western bank, to the great bend thereof, next above the place where a certain creek or river called Uchee, (being the first considerable stream on the western side above the Cusseta and Coweta towns) empties into the said river Chattahoochie; thence in a direct line to Nickajack on Tennessee river. A rich and fertile territory was thus [Illegible Text], and two States important and flourishing have from thence sprung up, which annually increase, and by their progress and improvements, strengthen and support the most [Illegible Text] wishes formed in respect to the rapid extension of our country, and the augmentation of its population. Whilst acting with such liberality, and yet want of policy, it could not have been cenceived, that any disputes would ever arise, by which the reserved limits of Georgia would be encroached upon, or any doubt as to the true construction of any of the Articles of Cession. The Commissioners of Georgia were no doubt impressed with this belief, when they met those of Alabama in 1826. They contended first, that a point was designated on the river Chattahoochie, answering the description given of it in the articles, which point they had ascertained from examination of the country. They represented and stated Miller's Bend, or the Big Shoal, to be of extraordinary size; that it was the great bend next above the place where a considerable stream above the Cusseta and Coweta towns, empties into the ChattahoochieThat the name of Uchee was not to be found attached to any [Illegible Text] in the neighborhood, but the description given identified Miller's Bend as the place referred to by the Commissioners who formed the compact of 1802. [Illegible Text] was discoverable only by being the first considerable stream above the Cusseta and Coweta towns, on the western side of the Chattahoochie, and Miller's [Illegible Text] next above said stream. Miller's Bend answered the description assigned it in the article, and though many other bends might be discovered, yet it was more distinctively characterised than any other. On the part of the Alabama Commissioners it was said, that the boundary as proposed, left a narrow strip between it and the Chattahoochie, and</p><p>The house again went into committee of the whole, mr. Byne in formed an acute angle with that river. Secondly, that the Weehatkee, was a larger stream than [Illegible Text] Wocchoochee, and had other descriptive marks which identified it as the stream referred to in the article under the name of Uchee.</p>

<page id="GA1828.1.P251" no="GA1828.1.252" />

<p>The Commissioners of Georgia replied to these objections, [Illegible Text] although much inconvenience might result by establishing the boundary as prescribed in the article; yet, reasoning deduced from convenience could not affect the terms or change the import of a compact. That if the commissioners appointed in 1802, had previously to the entering on their duties been acquainted with the country ceded, they would have consulted both private and public interest, in the form to be given to the line of boundary; but in an unexplored country, with defective and incorrect charts or maps, information concerning its locality, would be as various [Illegible Text] dissentient as the channels through which they were communicated. That although the Wehatkee is the largest stream above the Cusseta and Coweta Towns, the article described the first considerable stream emptying into the river above those towns, and not the largest streamThat the identity of Uchee being established, it was immaterial whether the towns be above or below it, they being a mere accident or [Illegible Text] to identify the creek. That though convenience might induce a change of those towns, nothing but a convulsion of nature could change the bend or the creek.</p><p>The Committee by adhering as closely as possible to the language of the Commissioners, have given a compend of their argumentsThe Committee animadvert with no pleasant feelings to the course pursued by the Legislature of Alabama; they will not however, use retaliatory language, or reply to their protest in the angry spirit which [Illegible Text] it. The close affinity, the sincerity in the habits and character of the people of the two States, should induce the kindliest feelingsSlight and trivial cause will not produce a revulsion of those feelings, which nature has formed and which time will cement. We must deny that any imputation has ever been cast upon the Commissioners who negotiated the Compact in 1802. Their venerated and exalted characters are common property and dear to the nation; but no names however emblazoned with good and great acts, can weigh against deductions founded in reason and supported by facts. The names of those who negotiated treaties, have never been [Illegible Text] as authority in ascertaining their meaning and intent, or [Illegible Text] their construction. In our sound reason, and without the least exercise of [Illegible Text], we see nothing monstrous or [Illegible Text] in supposing Messrs. Madison, Gallatin, and Lincoln, should have located [Illegible Text] artificial boundary on the margin of a natural one. That the assumption of that fact, would be a charge on those highly talented and gifted men of egregious folly, we cannot assent to as a self-evident proposition or an [Illegible Text] truth. In the protection of reserved rights Georgia has displayed as keen sensibility [Illegible Text] other of her sister StatesShe has been firm in sustaining her [Illegible Text]She will never [Illegible Text] the invasion of [Illegible Text] rights. We cannot permit to pass undenied the accusation of a disposition to invade the rights of Alabama, of [Illegible Text] so [Illegible Text] a disregard to principles, the support of which has brought upon Georgia [Illegible Text] reproach and unwarranted suspicious. She [Illegible Text], [Illegible Text] those [Illegible Text] [Illegible Text] save but by one State (the [Illegible Text], and gifted State of Virginia)She will be the <i>last</i> to desert

them. The protection of personal rights, and the quiet enjoyment of property by their citizens, require the respective States interested in this matter, to terminate speedily, a dispute with regard to boundary, which neither involves extensive territory or rich possessions; and an amicable and conciliatory spirit will reconcile differences which are only increased by intemperate and warm expressions.Your Committee believe Alabama will not persist in error, but be ready to unite in the ascertamment of truth.
