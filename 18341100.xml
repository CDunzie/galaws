<law id="R1834V1N205" initial.page="273"><p>IN SENATE.</p><p>The committee on the State of the Republic to whom was referred the communication of his Excellency the Governor, and the accompanying documents on the subject of the claim of the State of Georgia against the United States growing out of services rendered, and moneys paid by the State during the revolutionary war, report:</p><p>That from said documents it appears that this State has a claim for said services and moneys paid, ascertained by an agent of the Government of the United States, as long ago as the year seventeen hundred and eighty-five, and for which the said agent issued his certificate.</p><p>This claim at that time amounted to one hundred and twenty-three thousand two hundred and eighty-three dollars and seventy cents. Subsequently to the issuing of said certificate, an act of Congress was passed for the appointment of commissioners to settle the accounts between the United States and the States of the Union; and the commissioner appointed under the authority of said act made a report, which was submitted to the Congress in seventeen hundred and ninety-three, and in which Georgia was admitted to be a creditor of the Government of the Union, to the amount of nineteen thousand nine hundred and eighty-eight dollars. It does not appear that the commissioner who made said report took into consideration the amount due the State as ascertained by the agent in seventeen hundred and eighty-five, so that this large debt seems now to be due to this State. This claim has been repeatedly urged upon the consideration of the Government until it was finally rejected, upon the inequitable plea of the statute of limitations, as long ago as seventeen hundred and ninety-five. Your committee cannot believe that the Government of the Union will persist in a defence so discreditable to itself, against a just claim. The payment of this claim has been postponed by the Government itself, while claims of a similar nature have long since been discharged to other States. It is therefore a debt on which interest is not only legally but equitably demandable, and on which your committee cannot believe the Government will hesitate to pay the interest. The evidence necessary to the

<page id="GA1834.1.P272" no="GA1834.1.274" />

close investigation of this claim, is to be found in the records of the General Government; and it must require much labour and research to exhibit in a favourable aspect so antiquated a demand. Your committee therefore recommend the adoption of the following resolution:</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That his Excellency the Governor be authorized to employ some fit and proper agent to prosecute, before the General Government, the claim of the State of Georgia against the United States for services rendered and moneys paid by the State during the Revolutionary War; and that his Excellency the Governor be authorized to stipulate with the said agent, that he shall receive a sum not exceeding ten per cent. on the amount received, as a full compensation for his services.</p><p>Read and agreed to, 19th Dec. 1834.</p><p>JACOB WOOD,</p><p>President of the Senate.</p><p>AttestJOHN A.

Instead of having our young men brought up and educated in idleness and dissipation, with mind and body enervated by indolence and luxury, these schools would send them out into society well educated, industrious, practical business men, not useless drones and idling loungers, but hardy, enterprising, active, and useful members of the community.</p><p>These schools, under proper regulations, will educate our young men for the real business of life, and prepare them for any occupation they may wish to follow, for farmers, mechanics, and all other pursuits and professions.

<law id="R1834V1N211" initial.page="281"><p>IN SENATE.</p><p>The committee on public education and free-schools, to whom was referred that part of the Governor's message relative to the establishment of an institution for the education of the deaf and dumb in Georgia, having availed themselves of all the documents and correspondence furnished by that department as well as other sources of information; and having given the subject the reflection which its importance required, beg leave to submit the following report:</p><p>In order to awaken in this General Assembly a lively interest in behalf of this unfortunate class of our fellow-citizens, it will only be necessary to show, from satisfactory data, the number of deaf and dumb persons in our State, and the extent to which their unfortunate condition may be ameliorated by a proper system of instruction. It has been satisfactorily ascertained by careful enumeration, both in Europe and in this country, that about <i>one</i> in every <i>two thousand</i> persons is of the class denominated <i>mutes,</i> or <i>deaf</i> and <i>dumb;</i> and farther to excite the exertions of the benevolent and elicit governmental aid for their relief, it has been demonstrated by calculations, and the fact confirmed by reference to all the institutions for their relief, that the larger portion of them are in circumstances requiring the aid of institutions for their instruction free of expense to themselves or their friends. By the census of 1830, it appears, that in the United States, in a population of about 13,000,000, there are about <i>six thousand two hundred</i> deaf and dumb persons; and in the State of Georgia, in about 300,000 white inhabitants, <i>one hundred and forty-five</i> of all ages, viz.fifty under the age of fourteen years, fifty-one between fourteen and twenty-five, and forty-four over the age of twenty-five years. The proportion of mutes, as ascertained by the census of the United States in 1830, your committee would remark, is found to agree with that of a similar enumeration in Europe, where the subject has, for the last twenty years, received the careful attention of the benevolent and enlightened. These facts, which it is believed may be certainly relied on as correct, afford strong grounds, in the opinion of

<page id="GA1834.1.P280" no="GA1834.1.282" />

your committee, for an appeal to this enlightened Legislature for relief in behalf of so large a portion of their fellowcitizens, whose condition, under Providence, has been thus unfortunate and dependent.</p><p>That the circumstances and condition of this unfortunate class admit of great amelioration and the most astonishing improvement, is clearly manifested by reference to the enlarged faculties and the multiplied enjoyments of those who have been subjects of instruction in institutions which the enlightened bene volence and philanthropy of the present age have established for their education. More than twenty years ago the attention of enlightened and philanthropic individuals in France was turned to this subject; and under the distinguished Abb L'Eppee the system of instruction received a substantive form, which was improved and perfected by the scientific skill of the able Sicard, to whom mainly we owe the blessings of the system as now practised in Europe and America. It was introduced into the United States as early as the year 1817, and established by the pupils of these eminent philosophers and benefactors of mankind. Those institutions, so far as your committee can ascertain, have had their origin in associations of benevolent individuals, and received from several of the States charters and endowments; and in one instance a donation from the Congress of the United States. The American Asylum for the deaf and dumb in Hartford, Connecticut, was endowed with a grant of twenty-three thousand acres of the public lands; besides which, it receives regular appropriations from six different States for the education of the indigent deaf and dumb. There is an institution of the same character at Philadelphia, endowed by three or four different States; and as your committee are informed, another in each of the States of Kentucky, Ohip, and North Carolina. Under the benign influence of these institutions, the unfortunate deaf and dumb have been transported from intellectual darkness to all the light of cultivated intellect; and the gloomy lot, the mental inanition of the mute has been exchanged for the pleasure of society, the delight of social converse, and the gratification of epistolary correspondence; his benighted mind illumined by the rays of science and philosophy, and his soul lighted up with the truths and cheered with the hopes of the religion of a Saviour. Not less than six or seven hundred have received the benefits of education since the introduction of the system into the United States; and such is its progressive success here and abroad, that recent accounts give information of the startling fact that the <i>dumb</i> have been taught to

<i>speak articulately</i>which is rendered, however, less to be doubted from its having been ascertained that one-half of the mutes are born with the usual senses and faculties, but are reduced to their condition by the loss of hearing in early infancy. And while benevolent associations and enlightened legislatures are vieing with each other in exertions thus to ameliorate the condition of the unfortunate, will the proud State of Georgia, with her rich resources, refuse her contribution?</p><p>But while your committee would thus invoke the aid of the Legislature in behalf of this class of our citizens, they cannot recommend the plan of establishing an institution for their benefit from the funds of the State. From all the information within their reach, and reports from the managers of the deaf and dumb asylums, it satisfactorily appears that <i>six</i> institutions will be sufficient for many years to educate all the deaf and dumb of the United States, even with the progressive increase of population.</p><p>Having ascertained the fact, that one in two thousand is deaf and dumb, it follows that in a population of thirteen millions, there will be something more than six thousand of this class, it is well ascertained that the births in the United States are nearly as one to twenty of our population annually; and estimating the white population of Georgia at three hundred thousand, there would be less than ten deaf and dumb children born annually in the State, deducting the proper proportion of those who would die before the age of ten (the earliest period for the commencement of their instruction), there would remain a number annually requiring the benefits of the institution, far too small to render its establishment, in the opinion of your committee, a measure of sound policy, as respects economy of expenditure; especially when the fact already mentioned is adverted to, that fully one-half are indigent, and unable to defray any portion of their expense. By the treasurer's report, it appears that the salaries of the necessary officers and instructors in the Philadelphia institution, for seventy-two scholars, amount alone to more than three thousand dollars; and the purchase of land and erecting of suitable buildings could not be estimated at less than ten thousand dollars. The amount received from pupils, able to defray their own expenses, could bear no proportion to this expense, even should the manual labour system be introduced, which has been connected with such institutions in the Northern States for more than ten years past, and which your committee would deem a most important part of the plan.</p>

<page id="GA1834.1.P282" no="GA1834.1.284" />

<p>Instead of establishing such an institution in our own State at an expense so disproportionate to the cost of instruction elsewhere, your committee would recommend to the Legislature the propriety of appropriating for the present such a sum of money from the Treasury of the State as will be sufficient to educate all the indigent mutes in the State, between the ages of twelve and twenty years at the Institution at Hartford, the one in Philadelphia, or such other, elsewhere established, as the interest of the State and of the beneficiaries of its bounty may require. From documents before them, the committee would estimate the probable number of mutes to be educated by the donation of the State at twenty-five, and the annual expense at one hundred and fifty dollars. An objection may probably present itself, growing out of the extreme reluctance of parents and children to separation by so great a distance; but your committee feel assured, that on no other plan which can immediately be adopted, would the funds of the State be productive of so much benefit to this class of its citizens, so eminently entitled to her liberal donations. Your committee would therefore repectfully submit for adoption the following resolutions:</p><p><list><item><p>1. <i>Resolved,</i> That the sum of three thousand dollars be, and it is hereby appropriated for the education of the indigent deaf and dumb of this State between the ages of twelve and twenty years, in such manner as the General Assembly may deem best calculated to effect the benevolent object of the appropriation: and that the foregoing appropriation be inserted in the appropriation bill.</p></item><item><p>2. <i>Resolved,</i> That our Senators and Representatives in Congress be requested to make every effort for the purpose of procuring for each State a township of the public land, or such other quantity as they may be able to obtain, with a view of creating a fund in each State, the interest of which shall be appropriated to the education of the indigent deaf and dumb, and that his Excellency the Governor be requested to forward to our Senators, and to each of our Representatives and Representatives elect in Congress, a copy of these resolutions.</p></item><item><p>3. <i>Resolved,</i> That this State will appropriate the sum of ten thousand dollars, so soon as two or more of her neighbouring States will co-operate with her, and contribute in a ratio proportioned to the number of their free white inhabitants, for the purpose of endowing a Southern Institution for the education of the deaf and dumb, to be located at such place and organized in such manner as may hereafter be determined

<law id="R1834V1N214" initial.page="288"><p>IN SENATE.</p><p>The standing committee to whom was referred so much of the Governor's message as relates to internal improvement, from the nature of the subject committed to it, feels bound at this early stage of the session to call the attention of the Legislature to an investigation of, and determination on, those measures which shall be proper to give to the good citizens of this State the necessary facilities to a market for their products and for their supplies.</p><p>The state of Georgia has a large extent of territory, with a climate so diversified that she can, if need be, produce, not only the great staples of the south, but also all such necessaries, comforts, and luxuries as may make her wholly independent of the world beside for any of them. In one section, sea island cotton, the most valuable in the world, and rice, are the natural products of the soil and climate. In another, cotton of an inferior quality, but in far greater quantities, is grown; in another, grain is more congenial; and in all, the growth of the whole world may with a little care be naturalized. The lands of the seaboard are worked so profitably in the growth of rice and sea island cotton, to which they are so peculiarly adapted, that the section in which they lie can better afford to buy its supplies of grain, meat, c., than to produce them; and unable to draw these supplies from the interior of the State from the want of a means of conveyance, thousands and hundreds of thousands are paid to the grain growing countries of the north for those supplies, which in the interior, for the want of a market, are rotting in the hands of the grower. In the interior, short staple cotton is made in abundance, and would be a mine of wealth to the planter, but that he must incur an expense of at least ten per cent. in getting it to market. Grain of all sorts is also grown in the interior in quantities more than is necessary to supply the wants of the seaboard, but the grower is paralyzed by the difficulty of getting this article to market. Indian corn, the great article of food in the low country, and of which not less than 300,000 bushels are annually imported into the city of Savannah alone from the north, at an outlay of $200,000, can be and will be grown in the interior in quantities sufficient for this supply, whenever it can be made an article of profit to the grower; and this can be done by giving him a means of conveyance,

<page id="GA1834.1.P287" no="GA1834.1.289" />

in which the cost will not consume the profits. The State then, as a whole, can be made independent of the world for its supplies; but this can only be done by enabling each part to derive what it cannot advantageously grow, from those sections which can most profitably produce what is thus elsewhere wanted. This can be done by a great scheme of internal improvement. Preceding legislatures have been aware of this fact, and the committee feel that they are asserting facts which will not be controverted. But the committee have for object to show, that the past measures of the State, in partial and local legislation, have not been of a character to remedy the evil. The many appropriations for improving the navigation of rivers, and the opening of roads to a market, have been of a laudable character from the motive which has actuated the measures; but they have been of mistaken policy, as the result has shown.</p><p>Our rivers are of such a character as that efforts to affect any permanent improvement in the navigation of them have been and must continue to be abortive. The shoals in them, when removed from one point immediately accumulate in another; and the experience of the past shows plainly that the whole annual revenue of this State, if applied to this purpose alone, could not accomplish the object. Roads may be opened and kept in order, but still they do not afford the facilities which the exigency of the times requires. Our sister States, older and more experienced than ourselves in the arts, commerce, and agriculture, have shown us the means by which to make our great resources available; the experiment has been made by them. At first, like ourselves, they left to the enterprise of individuals and private corporations the opening those channels of communication; but soon it was discovered that the wants of the country could not be satisfied in this way. The want of means in some instances, the clashing of interests in others, and the slow progress in all, showed that the country to be benefited must be so by state action. A great man in New-York had the sagacity to discover this truth, and patriotism and firmness to stake his high character on a new scheme, which for a while met with so much opposition as to prostrate him, but which in the end vindicated his views, placed him in the class of benefactors of mankind, and gave to his native State that command of her resources which has made her the shining star in our constellation. Pennsylvania and other States followed this great example; and we now see the state of Ohio, one of the progeny of the old thirteen, with gigantic strides assuming a rank which, without her system of internal improvements, she never could

<page id="GA1834.1.P288" no="GA1834.1.290" />

have attained. It may be said that the state of Pennsylvania has involved herself in an immense load of debt, and that her canals and her railroads have as yet been insufficient to pay the interest on the debt incurred by them.</p><p>This may be admitted, and yet the argument lose its force; if it be recollected that the state at once entered on a scheme of the largest scale, and attempting every thing at once, the result, as a matter of profit, is not to be known until the whole is complete. And if also it be recollected that though the work may never pay to the state the money expended, the advantages to the citizens have been and will continue to be more, infinitely more, than sufficient to counterbalance the cost. Her works have not been profitable, because her rates of toll have been low to counteract the competition of neighbouring states, and because her citizens have preferred to pay in taxes what a low rate of toll might make necessary. In our own neighbourhood, our sister states are awake to the subject; and projects are on foot in every quarter to draw from the state her products, and to make us dependent on them for our supplies: and it is now a question, whether there is that pride of state which will alarm our jealousies of being made tributary to another, or whether we are supinely to submit to the degrading condition of dependence on them. For years past, acts of private incorporations for these purposes have been granted, and we have hoped that there was sufficient of individual enterprise and capital in the state to effect some work of internal improvement. Experience has, however, shown these hopes to be delusive, although there is still a show of an attempt at this work through individual or private enterprise. This committee believes that the state in general can only be permanently benefited by some great work on the resources of the state, and as a state undertaking wholly. By the adoption of this course, under the direction of an intelligent board of public works, a base may at once be established on which the state may hereafter build a superstructure not surpassed by any other state; the interior may find a ready outlet for their superabundant products; the seaboard may find its supplies from the interior of the state; itself may acquire a capital which will hereafter render taxation unnecessary; build up our schools, and all other institutions tending to the happiness, welfare, and comfort of its citizens, and make them dependent on each other only for the supplies. Deeply impressed with the correctness of these views, and with a sense of the importance of action on them before the trade of the state shall have made for itself a channel from which it may be difficult to divert it, the committee have

<page id="GA1834.1.P289" no="GA1834.1.291" />

studied the question as to the mode of raising the means necessary for this purpose.</p><p>The committee is aware of the reluctance of the Legislature to encroach on the stocks held by the State in the different banks, and that the funds of the Central Bank are now so diffused among the citizens that they cannot readily be called in, and have therefore come to the conclusion that a loan of money on the credit of the State will be more advantageous than any other course.</p><p>The resources of this State are so amplefree as it is from debt, there can be no difficulty in raising from capitalists any amount that might be necessary at a low rate of interest, on a term of years which would admit of repayment from the profits of the work. The advantages of this course would be not only withdrawing none of the capital now employed in this State from commerce, but in actually introducing into the State an additional capital to be diffused among her citizens. The committee, influenced by these considerations, respectfully recommend to the Legislature the adoption of such measures as will, through a board of public works authorized to obtain money on the credit of the State, establish a base of internal communication from our seaboard to some central point in our State, on which hereafter can be extended those branches which, like the veins of the human system, may pervade every part of the State, and give a healthy action to the wholeand therefore offer the following resolution:</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That the times require, and the resources of the State authorize a scheme of internal improvement from the seaboard of this State to the interior by railroad, on the faith and credit of the State, and as a great State work.</p><p>Agreed to, Nov. 29th, 1834.</p><p>JACOB WOOD,</p><p>President of the Senate.</p><p>AttestJOHN A.

<law id="R1834V1N229" initial.page="308"><p>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.</p><p>The select committee to whom was referred the Governor's message communicating the information that the <i>small-pox</i> had made its appearance in Coweta county, and the claim of the corporation of Savannah for disbursements made under the quarantine laws of this State, have had the same under consideration; and on the first branch of the communication beg leave to report:That from the respectable source from which the information emanates, no doubt is entertained by the committee of the appearance of this dreadful pestilence in Coweta county; and that unless prompt and efficient measures be taken to prevent its spread, it will soon be so disseminated through the country as to defy the possibility of arrest; that the only measure which this committee can consider adequate to the exigency is to authorize the Inferior Court of that county to <i>provide,</i> at the <i>expense</i> of the State, a temporary <i>hospital</i> in some isolated house, to which to remove all who have been or may be affected, and to employ a competent nurse and physician, and a guard to prevent communication of the sick and their attendants with others; and further to authorize and request his Excellency the Governor to procure vaccine matter, to be by him distributed in Coweta county and its neighbourhood. On the second branch of the subject submitted, the committee has examined the fourteenth section of the act of 1793, and is satisfied that the claim of the corporation of Savannah to reimbursement of the money expended by it, amounting to the sum of $1511, 16 is just, and ought to be paid out of the funds of the State. By a reference to the quarantine laws it will be obvious that those laws are not intended for the particular protection of any section of the State, but to prevent the entrance in or spread of any malignant or contagious disease over the State; and power to enforce these laws is given to particular bodies, not because those bodies are instructed with the safety of any particular section, but because of the necessity of vesting this power where the exercise of it may first be required, and where that exercise may smother and extinguish the evil on its first appearance: the power to enforce these laws is vested in the Governor, but if it were confined to him the ravages of disease might be great, and the country generally infested before he could be informed of the necessity of action: those powers have been therefore wisely confided also to other bodies, and more especially

<page id="GA1834.1.P307" no="GA1834.1.309" />

to the corporations of our seaboard towns, where the entrance of pestilence is most likely to be made; but it was never contemplated that the expense of this protection, intended for all, should fall on and be exclusively bound by that particular spot, which, unfortunately for itself, should be the point first attacked; if this were the case, a general quarantine law would be unnecessary, if not entirely inefficient; for no corporation or town would feel under obligation to do more than expel from its limits the subjects of the disease; the principles of humanity would be outraged, and the safety of the State would not be secured. The act of 1793 and subsequent acts show the views entertained by preceding Legislatures, and therefore the appropriation from the contingent fund by that law for the payment of any such disbursements. This committee have learned from another source, and feel bound to communicate the fact, that the small-pox now in Coweta county was taken from Savannah to that county, and that it was introduced into the city of Savannah under circumstances that ought to be known to the Legislature. A ship from New-York arrived at Savannah with a number of passengers on board; in a few hours after her arrival it was discovered that there was or had been a case of small-pox on board; the passengers were immediately compelled to return on board of the ship; and then it became a matter of serious consideration with the corporate authorities what disposition were to be made of the passengers and crew of this vessel. They could not be sent to the poor-house and hospital without danger of infection to the patients, then the occupants of that building; the objections of confining them on board of the ship at the most unhealthy season of the year was as strong, as it exposed them to almost certain death; and the fear of infection made it difficult to provide suitable accommodation for them in the country. Under those circumstances the committee is informed that the corporation adopted the only course in its power, consistent with a due regard to humanity, to prevent the spread of the disease. Isolated buildings at a distance from the city were hired; those infected or believed to be liable to the disease were removed; nurses, physicians, and guards were employed, and the rest of the passengers were discharged, as that corporation had no suitable receptacle for them; and it is believed that the disease was conveyed to Coweta county by one of the passengers so discharged. The committee has felt itself obliged to go into this detail to show how this disease was introduced into the State, how its introduction might have been prevented, or in what manner it might have been prevented, or in what manner it might at least have been

<page id="GA1834.1.P308" no="GA1834.1.310" />

confined to the spot where it first made its appearance. Had there been a lazarretto in or near the city of Savannah to receive the passengers and crew, the disease must have been arrested then; and the great expense now incurred, and probably to be increased before we shall be rid of the disease, would have been avoided. This committee is informed that the ordinary expenses of the city of Savannah, in the enforcement of the health and quarantine laws, are heavy; and that as these expenses are borne by the citizens, it is but reasonable that a lazarretto for the reception of such cases for the future protection of the State, should be built at the expense of the State, to be afterward maintained and kept up at the expense of said corporation. So indespensable is such a receptacle considered, that the health officer of Savannah, Dr. Habersham, as this committee is informed, resigned his office, declaring that the enforcement of the quarantine laws was utterly impraticable without it, and that he would not hold an office, the duties of which, for the want of this receptacle, he could not discharge. The committee is informed that such a receptacle would increase the expenses of the corporation, as the employment of a resident physician, nurses, and domestics would ensue; but that that corporation, with the means thus afforded of rendering effectual protection to her citizens and the State, would not object to such additional expense. This committee have taken into consideration the probable cost of such a building and the necessary out-buildings, and having regard to the object to be attained, believe that the sum of $15,000 would not be too large a sum for the purpose; and therefore beg leave to offer for adoption the following resolutions:</p><p><list><item><p>1st. <i>Be it resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of Georgia in General Assembly met,</i> That his Excellency the Governor be authorized and requested to procure a sufficient quantity of vaccine matter to be distributed among such physicians of Coweta and the neighbouring counties as will use it gratuitously.</p></item><item><p>2d. <i>Be it further resolved,</i> That the Justices of the Inferior Court of Coweta, and also of any other county in which the disease may appear, be, and they are hereby authorized and empowered to provide a temporary hospital, to which to remove all who have been or may be infected by small pox, and to employ suitable attendants and a guard to prevent the communication of the sick and their attendants with others, the expense of which shall be paid from the treasury of the State on the warrant of the Governor.</p></item>

Digest, page 323), and that the same was located and surveyed in conformity with the act passed on the 25th of February, 1784. Your committee, on examining the law passed on the 25th of February, 1784, find that the lands lying between the north and south forks of the Oconee river are declared and deemed to be a reserve, to make good the engagements to the officers, seamen, and soldiers entitled to lands in Georgia; and in conformity with the above-mentioned acts, the surveys and locations were made with the most candid and scrupulous regard to the laws before mentioned, and by surveyors whose individual characters this committee believe were a guarantee of the fairness and correctness of their transactions (so far as they were concerned in making the surveys on what they deemed to be the continental reserve); at least, no blame can possibly be attached to the petitioner for the locations of the warrants, as your committee are informed that he was at that time on business in the State of Virginia, and did not attend the locations of his warrants personally. But by a treaty made in New-York in 1790 with the Creek Indians, the lands (set apart for quieting the claims of the officers, seamen, and soldiers entitled to lands in Georgia, and in which the warrants of your petitioner were located) were excluded from our limits; consequently the well-earned portion of your petitioner was lost.</p><p>The said lands were obtained from the Indians by a subsequent treaty, lotteried off, drawn for, and granted to other citizens. In examining the evidence touching this petition, your committee believe that the locations of the warrants of

your petitioner, on lands which surveyors thought at that time to belong to the State, but subsequently found to be without the limits, ought not in justice to exclude or bar the payment of the claim; and your committee believe that there is another circumstance that entitles this claim to the additional regard of this House. Agreeably to a statement made by the Hon. Peter Crawford, late of Columbia county (which statement accompanies this report), it appears that, after the conclusion of the revolutionary war, Mr. Wearet, in unison with the Hon. Abraham Baldwin, made a settlement between the government of the United States and the State of Georgia, and that all the lands granted to her officers, seamen, and soldiers, agreeably to the before-mentioned acts, were credited at our treasury at the rate of two dollars per acre. Your committee, after a careful investigation of said petition, consider it was constituting one of the class of the fair and just claims for which no satisfaction has ever been made by the State of Georgia, and are therefore of opinion that the prayer of the petitioner is just and right to be granted, and beg leave respectfully to submit the following resolution:</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That twenty-two hundred dollars be allowed to the said James Wood, for the loss of the two tracts of land granted to himself and brother Capt. Edward Wood, deceased, by the State of Georgia for their services as officers during the revolutionary war, and that the same be provided for in the appropriation bill.</p><p>Read and agreed to, Nov. 15th, 1834.</p><p>THOMAS GLASCOCK,</p><p>Speaker of the House of Representatives.</p><p>AttestJOSEPH STURGIS, Clerk.</p><p><i>In Senate,</i></p><p>Concurred in, 20th Dec. 1834.</p><p>JACOB WOOD,</p><p>President of the Senate.</p><p>AttestJOHN A.

<law id="R1834V1N234" initial.page="317"><p>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.</p><p>The Committee to whom were referred the claims of John H. Lowe, administrator on the estate of John Sillman make the following report:</p><p>It appears to your Committee, that on the 9th day of August, 1821, John Sillman became the purchaser of fraction No. 18, in pursuance of an act of the Legislature, passed the 22d of December, 1820, for the sum of $84; one-fourth of said purchase-money was paid in cash at the time of purchase, in accordance with the provisions of said act; the balance was to have been paid in three annual instalments of $21 each. It appears to your Committee, by the accounts of George R. Clayton, treasurer, endorsed upon the back of said bond, that the two first instalments, together with the interest thereon, were paid at the time they became due, leaving the last instalment on said bond due the State, viz.$21 on the 9th day of August, 1824.</p><p>And it further appears to your Committee, that on the 11th day of August, in the year 1821, under and by virtue of an act, the said John Sillman became the purchaser of fractions No. 170, 286, 288, for the sum of $699; one-fourth of which being paid in cash, left due three instalments of $174 75. It appears to your Committee, by the receipts of George R. Clayton, treasurer, endorsed upon the back of said bond, that the two first instalments, with interest thereon, were paid when they fell due. It also appears by the receipt of William Triplett, comptroller-general, that on the 18th day of April, 1825, the interest of the last instalment was paid up to that date, and $110 63 principal, which left a balance due upon last-mentioned bond at that date $64 12; which, together with the last instalment, with interest up to the last-mentioned date, due upon the first-mentioned bond, makes the sum of $86 24 due by the said John Sillman to the State of Georgia on said bonds. It appears further to your Committee, that the executions issued upon said bonds for more than was due thereon, and appears by the receipts of Ethon Melton, sheriff of Walton county, that on the 2d day of May, 1825, the said John Sillman paid said sheriff on said executions the sum of $205 93; which amount overpaid the State

<page id="GA1834.1.P316" no="GA1834.1.318" />

They therefore beg leave to request that the Treasurer's report and abstract, with a list of warrants drawn by the Governor for the political year eighteen hundred and thirty-four, may be taken as a part of this report. They feel it to be a pleasant duty to state, that the office of the Treasury is kept in a business-like and satisfactory manner, which reflects credit on the incumbent.</p><p>The Committee on Finance, to whom was referred the Comptroller-general's statement of the account of the Treasurer with the State of Georgia, report:That they have carefully examined the different items and calculations of this account, and find them carefully made, showing the receipts into the treasury from all sources $288,509 90, during the political year 1834; and disbursements in conformity to warrants, drawn for various services, amounting to $239,599 85; leaving a balance on hand of $48,910 08. Your committee further report, that they carefully examined into the general order of the office and condition of the records, and find all things in a condition reflecting credit on this officer, except a considerable amount unposted items arising from the necessity of arranging the affairs of the office after the confusion produced by the late fire on the State-House during the last winter.

<law id="R1834V1N241" initial.page="326"><p>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.</p><p>The select committee to whom was referred the consideration of the transactions of the Board of Directors of the Central Bank in regard to the renewal of the charter of the Bank of Darien, and also to the increase of stock in the Bank of Augusta, have investigated the subject, and [Illegible Text] report:</p><p>That the shares in the different banks, the property of the State, having been transferred to the Central Bank, the Board of those banks were properly the representatives of the State during the recess of the Legislature, on all questions arising in relation to them; that all communications on the subject can properly be addressed to that Board, whose duty thereupon was to act on such communications in their best judgment; and in their annual report to mention all prominent events which had in the course of the year come before it officially. That accordingly, when that Board was applied to to concur in the application of the Darien Bank for a renewal of its charter, it was its duty to express its assent or dissent to such application, and in its annual report to state that their concurrence had been asked and their action thereon: this it has done, and no more; and this committee cannot but approve the course of the Board in its report, in which no disposition is manifested or attempt made to give direction to the application; and the committee report, that on this subject there is no ground for censure; that the Board did but its duty, and would have been reprehensible had it done less.</p><p>In regard to the increase of the stock of the Bank of Augusta, the act of 1826 had authorized the increase when the stockholders should determine it. In December, 1833, they did determine on an increase, leaving to the directors as to the time of the sale of such increased stock: the law made the increase dependent on the resolution of the stockholders, and immediately on the adoption of that resolution the increase was by the law made.</p><p>The fourth resolution recognises the action of the stockholders on that day to be an increase; and insomuch as no further action of the stockholders was necessary, the committee considers that the stock of that bank was then increased, subject alone to the direction of the directors as to the time

<page id="GA1834.1.P325" no="GA1834.1.327" />

of sale. The act of the Legislature reserves to the State the right to one-sixth of such increase until the end of the session next after such increase. On this construction of the act and the resolutions it became the duty of the Board of the Central Bank, on its annual report, to state the part of such increase, and to call the attention of the Legislature to the necessity of an appropriation, if the right assured was to be taken advantage of. Had that Board failed so to do, and the [Illegible Text] of the State been forfeited, that Board would not have discharged its duty, and would justly have been reprehensible; if, on the other hand, this construction be not correct, and if the increase of stock is not made until a sale, still this committee can find no ground of censure on this ground of its report; for even were the suggestion for an appropriation immature, it evinced on the part of the Board only a sensitive anxiety for the interest of the State, laudable and correct, and such as should actuate every public officer, who, if he [Illegible Text] should do so rather in too close a regard for the welfare of the State [Illegible Text] otherwise. The committee on this branch of the subject can find no ground for the imputation of a disposition in that Board to interfere unnecessarily with the other moneyed institutions of the State.The committee therefore recommend the adoption of the following resolutions:</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That the Board of the Central Bank, in its annual return, did but its duty in informing the Governor, and through him the General Assembly, of its action in relation to the Bank of Darien and the Bank of Augusta.</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That the Directors of the Bank of Augusta have acted in conformity with the law in relation to the increase and sale of the stock of said Bank.</p><p>Read and agreed to, 12th Dec. 1834.</p><p>THOMAS GLASCOCK,</p><p>Speaker of the House of Representatives.</p><p>AttestJOSEPH STURGIS, Clerk.</p><p><i>In Senate,</i></p><p>Concurred in, 20th Dec. 1834.</p><p>JACOB WOOD,</p><p>President of the Senate.</p><p>AttestJOHN A.

Lyman, superintendent of the Eastern Division, in pursuance of an act of the last Legislature, sold for sixty-three thousand nine hundred and thirty-six dollars.</p><p>That the State's property of the above named description disposed of by N.

The neatness and good order of the institution give evidence of great care and attention on the part of its officers, and the specimens of work exhibited show much skill; indeed, the present condition and prospects of the institution justify the expectation

<page id="GA1834.1.P328" no="GA1834.1.330" />

that the penitentiary will not only be a corrective but a preventive of evil; and will, at no distant period, prove to be a source of income to the State. In looking over the reports of the several officers of this institution, the attention of your committee was specially arrested by a suggestion made by the principal keeper. That officer intimates the propriety of providing a stock of wagon and carriage timber, which shall be sufficient to last the institution three or four years; so that the institution may at all times have a sufficiency of seasoned timber for that kind of work. Your committee, being well aware of the necessity of having seasoned timber for that kind of work, and knowing that work of that kind made of unseasoned timber must soon come to pieces, and injure the character of the institution, would respectfully recommend an appropriation for that purpose, as the present resources of the institution cannot afford it.</p><p>Your committee can give evidence to the truth of a statement made in the report of the inspectors, in regard to the necessity of altering and enlarging some of the work-shops. It is stated in that report that some of the work-shops should be so altered as to enable some of the assistant keepers to have the workmen more in view, and that some of the shops are too small. Your committee coincide with the inspectors in the above opinion: some of the shops are evidently too small for the present number of workmen, and we may reasonably calculate on an additional number of convicts under the new penal code: your committee would therefore respectfully recommend an appropriation for that purpose.</p><p>Your committee have endeavoured to ascertain the propriety of covering the new building in the penitentiary with copper, as instructed by a resolution from the Senate, and have come to the conclusion that it is unnecessary, as the building has at this time a new and good roof; and even if the roof should by any means be caught on fire, no damage can accrue further than the destruction of the roof, the balance of the building being completely fire-proof. It appears from the report of the inspectors that the institution suffers some inconvenience, because the law requires that all the debts due to the institution, when put out for collection, should be placed in the hands of the collecting attorney for the penitentiary, and it frequently happens that debts become due from persons living out of the circuit in which he practises. Your committee apprehend the difficulty, and would respectfully suggest the propriety of obviating it.

<page id="GA1834.1.P329" no="GA1834.1.331" />

It appears from the report of the inspectors that the sum appropriated last year for constructing the cell buildings has proved insufficient; therefore a further appropriation for that purpose will be necessary.

Railroad Creek station, without any compensation. In 1833, this House by resolution appropriated $500 for his services; this resolution was not concurred in by the Senate, and of consequence he was not entitled to compensation. By the act of 1833, the public hands are directed to be sold by the superintendents: after this act was passed, it was discovered that the act had omitted to require from the superintendents a bond to account for the funds of such sale. A resolution to supply that omission was adopted; and by that resolution the Governor was authorized to appoint a competent person to take possession, in behalf of the State, of the slaves and other public property, whenever his Excellency might deem it expedient for the interest of the State, and to sel lthem under this resolution. The Governor. believing that the interest of the State required the appointment of a person other than William B. Davis, appointed Thomas King to this duty; and it thereby became the duty of said Davis to surrender the negroes, c. to King. From the documents submitted it appears he did not do so, but left King to get possession of them as he could. King succeeded in getting possession of the negroes; and a few days after some one or more of them absconded, or were enticed away; and finally, on the day appointed under the law for the sale, one of said negroes, by the name of Solomon, was not forthcoming; and from a letter from said Davis to the Central Bank, it appears that said negro was in the possession of Davis, and was afterward sold by him; but in what manner, whether at public or private sale, does not appear.</p><p>The Committee refrain from the expression of any opinion which might affect the criminal prosecution now pending in the Superior Court of Glynn county against said Davis, for inveigling said negro; but that the conduct of said Davis was most improper and highly censurable in possessing himself of said negro after the appointment of King; and that his subsequent sale was without proper authority, and that said sale is wholly void, this Committee cannot doubt.</p><p>The Committee have examined the accounts submitted, which appear to be sustained by the vouchers, except one charge, and that of so great a nature that it cannot be passed without notice; and the charge alluded to is one for $500 for his services as superintendent, when, by the resolution of 1832, it appears that his services were to be gratuitous, and so considered by himself, as is shown by his continuing to perform those duties, and when a resolution of this House in 1833, to give him $500, had been rejected by the Senate.

That this charge was most unaccountable and unauthorized was within the knowledge of said Davis. The Committee therefore respectfully offer the following resolutions:</p><p><list><item><p>1st. <i>Resolved,</i> That the conduct of William B. Davis, in failing to deliver the public hands to Thomas King, was censurable and improper.</p></item><item><p>2d. <i>Resolved,</i> That the sale of the negro Solomon, made by William B. Davis, was contrary to law and void, and his conduct in selling said negro highly censurable.</p></item><item><p>3d. <i>Resolved,</i> That the said negro be reclaimed for the State whenever found; and on recovery of him by the State, that he be sold as is ordered by the act of 1833.</p></item><item><p>4th. <i>Resolved,</i> That the solicitor-general of the Eastern Circuit be instructed and required to institute actions against said William B.

Davis to pay to the State the full value of said negro.</p></item><item><p>5th. <i>Resolved,</i> That the charge of $500, made by said William B.

Curry, have had both those papers under their most deliberate consideration, and, as the result of which, they present the following report:</p><p>Your committee deem it wholly unnecessary at this time to enter into a formal defence of the policy of the State which has been adopted for the settlement and government of that portion of the country now partly inhabited by Cherokees. It was not to have been expected that the Cherokees would yield a cheerful acquiescence in those measures which have been considered expedient by the State; but your committee learn with exceeding regret from the communication of the Governor now under consideration, as well as from his message delivered at the commencement of the present Legislature, that the discontents of this unfortunate people have been greatly aggravated by some of our own citizens; those whose highest obligation and most sacred duty was to guard the interest and advance the policy of the State. It is with exceeding regret that your committee learn from the letter of Major Curry, as well as from various sources of information corroborative of his statements, of the actual existence of the most alarming disorders and disturbance in the Cherokee country; and that those of a much more serious character are justly apprehended, unless some effectual measures are adopted to prevent them. It is also with the most unfeigned regret that your committee are informed by the same gentleman of the danger to which our own citizens, and those few Cherokees who have entered into the support of the laudable views and philanthropic purposes of the government, are exposed. Our enterprising and public-spirited citizens who have ventured into the country upon the invitation of the State have the strongest claims upon her for protection; and she would be recreant to every principle of justice if she was not to shield them against the possibility of injury from the quarter alluded to. Those of the Cherokees also who have, with the patriotic view of advancing the best interest of their people, espoused the cause of the

<page id="GA1834.1.P334" no="GA1834.1.336" />

government, have an equal right to demand protection and security. Your committee have entire confidence in the energy, watchfulness, and discretion of the Governor, and consider that the most ample means should be left within his control of rendering immediate assistance to our own people and the friendly Cherokees, whenever such assistance may become necessary. For these purposes your committee recommend the adoption of the following resolutions:</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That his Excellency the Governor be, and he is hereby authorized, when he may deem the exigency to demand it, to call out such force, under such command, and for the time he may consider necessary for the security, relief, and protection of our own citizens and the friendly Cherokees.</p><p><i>And be it further resolved,</i> That his Excellency the Governor be authorized to draw upon the contingent fund for the payment of all expenses which may be incurred by the foregoing resolutions.</p><p>Agreed to, 18th Dec. 1834.</p><p>THOMAS GLASCOCK,</p><p>Speaker of the House of Representatives.</p><p>AttestJOSEPH STURGIS, Clerk.</p><p><i>In Senate,</i></p><p>Concurred in, 20th Dec. 1834.</p><p>JACOB WOOD,</p><p>President of the Senate.</p><p>AttestJOHN A.

<law id="R1834V1N247" initial.page="337"><p>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.</p><p>The select committee to whom was referred the Executive communication of the 7th inst., with accompanying documents, report:</p><p>That the writ of citation which has been served upon his Excellency the Governor at the instance of James Graves, convicted before the Superior Court of Murray county of the crime of murder, as detailed in his Excellency's message, is, in the view of your committee, an attempt to abuse the process of the Supreme Court of the United States for the purpose of interfering with the ordinary criminal jurisdiction of this State, which, by the Constitution thereof, is vested exclusively in the Superior Courts.</p><p>The right to enforce the criminal laws of the State within her own limits is one of local character, essential to the preservation of peace and good order within her borders, clearly belonging to that residuary mass of sovereignty which is inherent in each State, and the exercise of which, although of vital importance to such State, does not interfere with the essential rights or interests of the other States in the confederacy. Your committee need not pause to show, by historical reference, that other States having an Indian population within their bounds have afforded a practical exposition of the right of a State to punish the perpetrators of crimes (whether Indian or white) committed within her limits. Your committee need only to refer to the recent case of George Tassels, in which our own State successfully carried out the principle in question.</p><p>Your committee briefly remark, that by reason of the government under which we live being partly federal and partly national, two distinct classes of cases arise, and that a just appreciation of the difference which exists between them will lead to a maintenance of the just rights of each State, while a due observance of those which belong to the United States will be preserved.</p><p>The right to regulate the interior police of a State is one of a local domestic character, belonging to that class of cases the legislation over which is exclusively vested in the State, and

<page id="GA1834.1.P336" no="GA1834.1.338" />

which should be asserted with that firmness, dignity, and moderation which should mark the deliberations of the representatives of the people.</p><p>Your committee observe, that from the letter of William G. Springer, the agent of the State, which accompanies the Executive message, they learn that from the course pursued by his Honour Judge Hooper (upon the propriety of which they disclaim the right of passing), a general determination has been excited among the Indians to maintain themselves against the policy and laws of this State; and your committee apprehend that some obstacle may be interposed by that determination between the sheriff of Murray county and the execution of the laws in the case of James Graves. They have therefore endeavoured to provide for such exigencies, by recommending the adoption of a resolution authorizing the sheriff, should he deem it necessary, to employ such force as will ensure the execution of the sentence in the above case.</p><p>Your committee, impressed with these views, respectfully recommend for adoption the following resolutions:</p><p><i>Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of Georgia in General Assembly met,</i> That they view with feelings of deep regret another attempt to interfere with the administration of the criminal laws of this State, by the use of the process of the Supreme Court of the United States.</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That the right to punish the perpetrators of crimes committed within the jurisdiction and chartered limits of this State is one of those residuary rights, the exercise of which is of vital importance to the domestic peace and internal economy of such State, and the practical operation of which can in nowise conflict with the essential rights or interests of her co-States.</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That his Excellency the Governor be, and he is hereby requested to communicate by express to the sheriff of Murray county the determination of this State to enforce her criminal laws; and that such orders be issued by him to that officer as will ensure the execution of the laws in the case of James Graves, convicted of murder in said county.</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That the sheriff of said county be, and he is hereby authorized and empowered to employ a guard of
