The first session of the succeeding General Assembly would convene on the fourth Wednesday in June, 1905. The Constitution requires the General Assembly to canvass the returns of the election for Governor and State House officers at the first session after their election. The successors of the present incumbents will be elected on the first Wednesday in October, 1904, but under the change contemplated by the provisions of this bill the returns for this election could not be canvassed and the result declared until the fourth Wednesday in June, 1905, thereby adding eight months to the terms of the present Governor and State House Officers. While it may be that this bill is not contrary to the letter of the Constitution, I can but feel that the extension of the present terms of these officers for a period so long as eight months is violative of its spirit.</p><p>The change will necessarily disorganize the existing fiscal conditions of the State, as will appear from the correspondence between the Treasurer and myself, a copy of which is hereto attached, and in this connection I beg to call your attention to the provisions of subsection 8 of section 199 of volume 1 of the Code, relating to the duty of the Treasurer, and which is as follows:</p><p><blockquote><p>He shall pay all funds pledged to the payment of the public debt, or interest thereon, or to any object of education, and to these objects only, and in no wise to any other purpose. All payments from the Treasury shall be paid from the fund appropriated for such purpose, and not from any other.</p></blockquote></p><p>This provision of the Code and the facts stated in the Treasurer's letter make manifest grave financial difficulties in the way of such a change.</p><p>For these reasons I return the bill without my approval.</p><p>J.
