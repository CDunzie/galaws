Not the least important stipulation in that compact, is, that a person charged with treason, felony, or other crime, who shall flee from justice, and be found in another State, shall, on demand of the Executive authority of the State from which he fled, be delivered up, to be removed to the State having jurisdiction of the crime</p><p>Doubtless the past legislation on this subject has been predicated upon the presumption that each State having, in the pledged faith of all the others, a sufficient guarantee, nothing more was requisite, than to prescribe the forms which should give authenticity to the demand. Doubtless, too, in the times which give birth to the Constitutionwhilst the Union was young, and her revolutionary associations fresh and warm, this presumption found its warrant in the mutual fidelity which promptly responded to all Executive demands. To this generation has been reserved the humiliating spectacle of a sovereign State making herself a city of refuge for fugitive felons from her sister confederates. Two such cases, of recent occurrence, demonstrate the utter inefficiency of the existing laws for carrying into effect this provision of the Constitution. They moreover clearly indicate the cause of this inefficiency. Those laws are dependant for their execution upon the mere will of the Executive officers of the several States, who neither are, nor can

<page id="GA1839.1.P228" no="GA1839.1.230" />

be made responsible to the General Government. If, then, it be correctly assumed, that the Federal Legislature is bound to make ample provision for the contemplated exigency, and if experience has proven that reliance on State authorities is delusive, the question occurs whether there be any other mode which gives fairer promise of security? May not the object be accomplished by employing, in that service, officers appointed by, and responsible to the Federal Government? Inasmuch as that Government has employed, in every State of the Union, competent judicial and ministerial officers, it is believed that this duty, enjoined by the highest obligations, and intimately connected with the harmony and perpetuity of the Union, may be appropriately and efficiently performed, through their instrumentality. There would seem to be a peculiar fitness in providing that the aid which she is bound to afford to the State judiciaries, should result from the action of her own judiciary. The process would be simple, and the agents directly responsible to the power whence the laws to be executed emanate:</p><p><i>Be it therefore resolved</i>, That the statutes of the United States, enacted to carry into effect the latter clause of the second section of the fourth article of the Constitution, are wholly inadequate to the object.</p><p><i>Be it further resolved</i>, That in the opinion of this General Assembly, those statutes should be so amended, as1st: To authorize the demand, in the cases contemplated, to be made upon the Circuit Judge of the United States having jurisdiction in the State wherein such fugitive may be found: SecondlyTo require that such Judge, upon such demand being made in due form of law, shall issue his warrant, to be directed to the Marshal of the United States, in the State wherein such fugitive may be, requiring his arrest and delivery to the agent duly authorized to receive him, who shall be named in such warrant. ThirdlyTo require each Marshal to whom any such warrant shall be delivered, forthwith to execute the same.</p><p><i>Be it further resolved</i>, That our Senators in Congress be instructed, and our Representatives be requested to have the act of Congress, passed on the 12th of February, 1793, to carry into effect the second section of the fourth article of the Constitution of the United States, so amended as to make it obligatory on the said District Judge to surrender any person who may be found in any State or Territory, and who is charged in any other State or Territory, with the commission of any act which is constituted a crime by the laws of said State or Territory where he is so charged, to the Executive authority of the State or Territory where the offence is alleged to have been committed.</p>
