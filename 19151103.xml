<div><title><b>PROCLAMATION BY THE GOVERNOR</b><br set="CENTER" /></title><p>(In the name and by the authority of the State of Georgia.)</p><p>WHEREAS, No appropriations to cover the necessary expenses of maintaining the several departments of the State government and the various institutions of the State after the year 1915 were made at the regular 1915 session of the General Assembly, although Article III, Section VII, Paragraph 11, of the Constitution of Georgia specifically provides that no money shall be drawn from the Treasury except by appropriation made by law; and <sidenote>Preamble.</sidenote></p><p>WHEREAS, It is necessary that such appropriations for the years 1916 and 1917 be made before the beginning of the year 1916, in order that the efficiency and continuity of the service of the departments and institutions of the State may be properly maintained; and</p><p>WHEREAS, Urgent need exists of deficiency and special appropriations in some cases to cover certain expenditures in several of the departments and institutions maintained by the State; and</p><p>WHEREAS, It appears to be impracticable to secure uniform and adequate enforcement of the laws prohibiting the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors as they at present exist, necessitating the early addition to, or amendment of, said laws in order to stop, as far as possible, a great, immediate and continuing injury and damage, moral, material and physical, to many of our people, and it is hoped put an end to the wave of unrest from the disregard of law that seems to have existed in some portions of our State for some time past; and</p><p>WHEREAS, The disposition of the Western and Atlantic Railroad at the expiration of the present lease is of great importance to our people, and every month of the time allowed for arranging the preliminaries is of value; and</p><p>WHEREAS, The question of facilitating credits between those forces that control capital on the one hand and those that control and handle the great volume of the products

<page id="GA1915.2.P5" no="GA1915.2.6" />

of the State on the other is of vital importance to the material welfare of the people of Georgia, especially at this time when methods have constantly to be readjusted on account of the great wars now being waged across the seas; and</p><p>WHEREAS, There appears to be serious danger of irreparable injury and damage to a new and growing industry in shrimp and prawn in our coast counties through the literal enforcement of our present laws for the protection of fish, which laws seem to be capable of revision in such manner as not only to preserve said shrimp and prawn industry without harm to the fisheries but to improve, conserve, and build up our natural resources in oysters as well, and to provide additional revenue thereby; and</p><p>WHEREAS, Some doubts have arisen concerning the validity of the Automobile License Tax, owing to the decisions of some of the courts touching the same, which tax it is stated amounts to about $110,000.00 annually, and the loss of which it is thought could be prevented by a slight amendment of the law providing methods for its collection and disposition; and</p><p>WHEREAS, The General Assembly does not meet in regular session until the fourth Wednesday in June, 1916,</p><p>NOW, Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by Article V, Section I, Paragraph 13, of the Constitution, I, Nat E. Harris, Governor of Georgia, do hereby convoke the General Assembly of the State in extraordinary session, to meet in their respective halls at the Capitol in Atlanta on the third day in November, A. D., 1915, at 10 o'clock, A. M., for the following objects, all of which are considered by the Executive of sufficient importance to make the necessity for such extraordinary session: <sidenote>Convocation.</sidenote></p><p>To consider and enact the general appropriation bill provided for in Article III, Section VII, Paragraph 9, of the Constitution for the years 1916 and 1917, taking such action on the items thereof as such General Assembly may deem advisable; <sidenote>General appropriations.</sidenote></p><p>To consider and take action upon such special and deficiency appropriations as in their judgment may be necessary to maintain the efficiency of the departments and

institutions of the State, as well as the authority of the government thereof; <sidenote>Deficiency appropriations.</sidenote></p><p>To consider broadly the question of prohibition, with the view of making such additions to, or changes in the present laws, as will, in the opinion of the General Assembly, secure uniform and adequate enforcement of the same, and prohibit the sale and manufacture of alcoholic, spirituous, malt, or intoxicating liquors within the bounds of the State of Georgia; <sidenote>Intoxicating liquors.</sidenote></p><p>To consider the question of the future disposition of the Western  Atlantic Railroad after the present lease expires, and to take such action thereon as may be deemed advisable at the extraordinary session; <sidenote>W.  A.

<div><title>GOVERNOR'S MESSAGE TO GENERAL ASSEMBLY.<br set="CENTER" /></title><pre>EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT, STATE OF GEORGIA.<br set="RIGHT">ATLANTA, November 3, 1915.<br set="RIGHT" /></br></pre><p>TO THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF GEORGIA:</p><p>The recent failure of your body to complete the work which was necessary to the proper continuance of the State government has compelled me to call you together in extraordinary session.</p><p>The proclamation convoking you is herewith laid before you for such attention as you shall deem it your duty to give it under the Constitution and laws of the State.</p><p>I need not now go into any discussion of the unparalleled circumstances which rendered the calling of this session necessary.</p><p>I realize the fact that the whole proceeding was brought about through the earnest and settled desire of a majority of your body to take up and consider certain legislation concerning the prohibition of the manufacture and sale of intoxicants in the State of Georgia, which desire a minority of your body prevented you from accomplishing. While the method adopted for compelling an extraordinary session was, I believe, without precedent in the history of our State, in fact was somewhat revolutionary, yet it serves to disclose in a very striking manner the settled determination of a majority of your body that the legislation referred to should be passed on by the General Assembly.</p><p>I congratulate you on the changed condition of the business affairs of the State since your last meeting. The increase in the price of cotton and other products has served to encourage our people, make money easier and arouse enthusiasm throughout all our business circles. The lessons of the great war are being studied and learned, and the promise is near by that our future progress will become more brilliant than has ever been anticipated by the most optimistic in our midst.</p><p>You will note that I have seen fit to lay before you the following objects, each of which was deemed by me of sufficient

<page id="GA1915.2.P9" no="GA1915.2.12" />

importance to make the necessity for such extraordinary session apparent:</p><p><list><item><p>1st. The consideration and enactment of the general appropriation bill, with all special and deficiency appropriations deemed proper by your body.</p></item><item><p>2nd. Prohibition in the broadest sense, so as to enable you to make such additions or changes under the present laws as will in your opinion secure uniform and adequate enforcement of these laws.</p></item><item><p>3rd. The future disposition of the Western  Atlantic Railroad.</p></item><item><p>4th. The establishment of a State warehouse system.</p></item><item><p>5th. The protection of the fish, oyster, prawn and shrimp business.</p></item><item><p>6th. The amendment of the law concerning the automobile license tax.</p></item></list></p><p>You can well understand that a large number of other matters was called to my attention during the time which elapsed between the adjournment and the call of the special session. Most of these matters were pending in various stages within the two houses at the time of the adjournment. I have not thought it well to throw the doors wide open, because in the extraordinary session none of the technical work done in the consideration of the various measures before the two houses can be utilized, but everything must begin anew. It will not be so at the regular session next year. I have tried to confine you, therefore, to such matters as seemed to me most pressing, and aside from their intrinsic importance, would seemingly arouse as little opposition in their consideration as possible, under the circumstances.</p><p>As to the first two great matters which I have included, namely, appropriations and prohibition, upon which the two houses have already divided in your deliberations at the recent session, I have hoped that, as most of the members of the General Assembly had made up their minds touching what they desired to do when the measures came up again, there need be no great amount of discussion before a vote can be taken. A useless prolongation of the extraordinary session would arouse much criticism throughout the State.</p>

<page id="GA1915.2.P10" no="GA1915.2.13" />

<div><title>APPROPRIATIONS.<br set="CENTER" /></title><p>Upon the attitude of your body towards the departments and institutions of the State, when you come to make appropriations, will depend in a large measure the usefulness and effectiveness of these portions of the government during the term for which you and I were elected.</p><p>While a large number of these appropriations are fixed as to amount by existing laws, yet the great bulk is left entirely to your discretion, and upon your good judgment as you deal with them must rest the financial ability of these departments and institutions to properly transact the business for which they were established. They work for the State. Our educational and charitable institutions, our penal establishment, as well as our governmental departments, have been brought into existence as necessary instruments of the State government, for the protection, prosperity and advancement of the inhabitants of the Commonwealth. You will decide whether during the two years for which you were elected they shall be enabled to properly perform their recognized and established functions, with that success which shall enable them to keep pace with the growth of the State, or whether they shall be crippled and restricted in their usefulness, and the whole State suffer accordingly.</p><p>While I know that it is necessary to exercise great caution in making appropriations so as to keep them within the bounds of the revenue raised to meet them, yet I sincerely believe that you, gentlemen of the General Assembly, will agree with me in the conclusion that it is necessary to give our institutions for the protection of persons and property, for the care of those suffering from mental and moral deficiencies, for the education of our children, a sufficient support, not only to maintain their present standards, but to enable them to continue to expand so as to meet the growing needs of the State.</p><p>I have suggested to you before, that a legislator's duty is best discharged by an effort to spend the revenue of the State judiciously, rather than to be constant in the effort to save the same.</p><p>It is penny-wise and pound-foolish to cut down an appropriation

<page id="GA1915.2.P11" no="GA1915.2.14" />

to a worthy institution on the idea that it will save a few dollars for the time being, when such institution is conducted for the purpose of providing care and shelter for the sick and insane, or even for giving educational facilities to the young. The progress lost in this way may never be regained. So I confidently hope that a law-making body like yours, which was willing to precipitate a revolution in parliamentary procedure in order to secure the opportunity to further protect those unfortunates, whose wills are not strong enough to resist the temptation to the excessive use of alcoholic stimulants, will certainly not diminish the amount of financial support heretofore given to institutions established on the one hand for the care of those who are already victims of such misfortune, or on the other for directing, molding, upbuilding and strengthening the characters and habits of the boys and girls who must be exposed to those evils in the future.</p><p>I call your attention to the work of investigation and research which was done by your committees at the recent session, in the gathering up of facts and statistics to ascertain the real wants of the various departments and institutions of our State, and with confidence, I commit the contents of each of these to the good judgment of the General Assembly.</p></div><div><title>CONTINGENT FUND AND GOVERNOR'S OFFICE FORCE.<br set="CENTER" /></title><p>I have already communicated to you at the regular session, the condition of the contingent fund, together with the difficulties encountered because of the limited appropriation for the Governor's office force.</p><p>The annual appropriation for the contingent fund, which amounts to $25,000.00, has been forced to meet several extraordinary calls, such as the salary of a messenger in the Executive Department, the salary of a valuation engineer for the Western  Atlantic Railroad, employed by my predecessor and continued by me, amounting together, to about $5,000.00, and the expense of the copper mine litigation and other payments, and as a consequence thereof the fund has run very short and will scarcely be sufficient to carry the State through the remaining three months of the year.</p>

<page id="GA1915.2.P12" no="GA1915.2.15" />

<p>I would be glad if the Legislature would either increase the fund or make special appropriations to cover some or all of the items above mentioned.</p><p>The employment of a messenger is made necessary by the fact that no appropriation has ever been made to furnish a stenographer to the Governor. He cannot prepare a State paper or answer a letter of one of his constituents without writing in his own hand or borrowing someone to take his dictation. I trust you will find some method in your wisdom to amend this situation.</p></div><div><title>STATE SANITARIUM FOR TUBERCULOSIS.<br set="CENTER" /></title><p>This institution established at Alto in this State has been suffering greatly for the want of funds. At your recent session an advance of $10,000.00 over the former appropriation for each of the years 1916 and 1917 was earnestly urged in behalf of this institution. I call special attention to this matter, because as the State has enlisted in the fight against this wide-spread disease, it will be necessary to increase from year to year the appropriation to this sanitarium, if it be expected that the institution perform even to a limited degree the great purpose for which it was established.</p></div><div><title>GEORGIA SANITARIUM AT MILLEDGEVILLE.<br set="CENTER" /></title><p>This institution is overcrowded and is sadly in need of additional funds. I call attention to the report of its operations and wants recently laid before your body.</p></div><div><title>GEORGIA TRAINING SCHOOL FOR GIRLS.<br set="CENTER" /></title><p>The Georgia Training School for Girls exhausted its funds for maintenance by June 1st of the present year and has been compelled to borrow in order to continue its sessions to this time.</p><p>It will be necessary in dealing with this institution if you desire to continue its effectiveness to make a special appropriation of some $5,000.00 in order to cover the deficit for 1915. This deficit was brought about by reason of the fact that the appropriation for the school began in the

<page id="GA1915.2.P13" no="GA1915.2.16" />

middle of the year instead of the first of the year, and consequently no appropriation was made for one-half of a year.</p></div><div><title>DEFICIENCY APPROPRIATIONS.<br set="CENTER" /></title><p>If the General Assembly should determine to include both the regular and deficiency appropriations in the same bill, then I respectfully call your attention to the large deficit existing in the printing fund. This was caused largely by the fact that the bills of the public printing establishment had run over from 1914 to 1915, in which latter year, with the exception of a very small amount, Governor Slaton paid the State printer $10,684.00 out of the appropriation made for the year 1915. This step was justified by the fact that the work was done for use during the fiscal year 1915.</p><p>The total amount appropriated to the printing fund for 1915 is therefore exhausted and there will be a deficit at the end of the year estimated at some $20,000.</p><p>This printing fund is under charge of the Secretary of State, the Comptroller-General and the Treasurer, and I am informed has been carefully audited and judiciously expended.</p><p>It appears that there have been two new departments of the State government created since the General Assembly of 1913 cut down this appropriation from $40,000.00 to $35,000.00 per year.</p><p>One of the largest items figuring in this deficit is the paying for the reprinting from electrotyped plates of Georgia Reports, which cost about $9,000.00. From this source the State will derive about $13,000.00, but this sum will be returned to the general fund of the Treasury instead of to the printing fund.</p><p>I earnestly recommend, therefore, that you take this matter up, deal with this deficit, and make such appropriation to cover the same as you shall deem best for the State.</p></div><div><title>DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS.<br set="CENTER" /></title><p>In the Department of Public Buildings and Grounds there is also an existing deficit which I call to your attention. Several irregularities have been recently discovered in the accounts of the Keeper of Public Buildings and

<page id="GA1915.2.P14" no="GA1915.2.17" />

Grounds. These accounts have been kept by the assistant keeper, who filled the position of Captain of the Guard. I had an audit made of this department by certified public accountants and we submit to you a copy of the report for your information.</p><p>This report shows outstanding bills against the State due by this department amounting to $14,210.83. It also discloses a default of $4,421.78, moneys applied to other purposes than for the use of the State.</p><p>The report has been referred to the Attorney-General with directions to insist upon the Keeper of Public Buildings and Grounds replacing the default aforementioned. Even if this amount is replaced there will still exist a deficit in the funds of the department of $9,789.05. While this is the apparent amount, the real deficit is probably even greater, since it seems that there is only left to the credit of this department funds sufficient to pay the salaries of the necessary employees for the remainder of the year, and afford nothing for the incidentals and supplies required to transact the business of the State at the Capitol. It would be best for the Legislature to make an appropriation sufficient to cover the total deficit and if the money is recovered from the principal keeper, it can be covered directly into the Treasury.</p></div><div><title>MILITARY DEPARTMENT.<br set="CENTER" /></title><p>There is a deficit also in the Military Department. The Adjutant-General reports that the sum immediately necessary to relieve the situation in that department amounts to something like $15,000.00 This sum is made up of the recent riot duty expenses, for which the regular appropriation could not be used, amounting to $5,376.15, which expense has been left unpaid so long that the creditors have almost grown hopeless; also of the charges for caretakers required by the Federal government, upon which the keeping of our field artillery depends, amounting to $5,000.00. Another item is armory rentals yet unpaid, which amounts to over $4,000.00, and which together with a number of other smaller claims make up the sum of $15,000.00.</p><p>I have already expressed myself as to the duty of improving and increasing the effectiveness of the National

<page id="GA1915.2.P15" no="GA1915.2.18" />

Guard of this State. I believe the State should co-operate with the National government in securing this result.</p><p>The men composing the National Guard prepare themselves at their own expense, for the protection of the life, liberty and property of the citizens in time of danger. They pay the expenses out of their own pockets and but for this our State would have no National Guard, and its judicial decrees would be without the ultimate power of enforcement.</p><p>I believe that a sufficient amount ought to be appropriated annually from the Treasury of this State to pay the expense of the maintenance of drill halls, the necessary servants' hire in connection with these halls and to pay for the men who must be kept on duty at all times in the Adjutant-General's and Quartermaster-General's departments, and in preserving and taking care of the equipment furnished for the troops, in anticipation of service.</p><p>No nation in the present exigencies of the world's advancement can occupy a high and commanding position unless it possesses trained armies or a citizenship educated to take the place of those in time of war. There was never a time in the history of the world when this fact was more distinctly emphasized, than at present. The Union consists of forty-eight Republics or States, and its armies must be drawn from the rank of the citizens of the several States. The country would be utterly hopeless in time of sudden invasion if these citizens were unable to reinforce the small standing army of the National government.</p></div><div><title>INSURANCE FUND.<br set="CENTER" /></title><p>There is also a deficit in the fire insurance fund if the law of the State which requires the Governor to insure all the property of the State (Code Sections 147 and 148) is to be literally enforced.</p><p>This deficit it is estimated will reach approximately the sum of $20,000.00. This situation grows out of the fact that the trustees of the eleven A.  M. Schools and Industrial School at Savannah have put in a claim to have their buildings insured. As this had never yet been done the question was referred to the Attorney-General, who

<page id="GA1915.2.P16" no="GA1915.2.19" />

decided that the law referred to was mandatory and that the insurance should be obtained. To do this an additional $20,000.00 will be required to the present appropriation for insurance.</p><p>I call the Legislature's atfention to the fact that no insurance is being carried on the Capitol building in Atlanta. It has been thought that the guards or watchmen employed in the building both night and day would give sufficient protection. It is a fact, however, that very recently a fire broke out in one of the rooms of the Capitol, by which a considerable amount of property was destroyed, without the guard being advised of the same.</p></div><div><title>OUR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS.<br set="CENTER" /></title><p>I sincerely hope that the General Assembly will find it possible to appropriate sufficient funds to our educational institutions to enable them to carry on their work with their present high state of efficiency, and if anything to increase, rather than diminish, their activities and usefulness.</p><p>I am informed that as a whole there is probably a larger attendance at these institutions than ever before, probably with one or two exceptions, due to local causes.</p></div><div><title>UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA AT ATHENS.<br set="CENTER" /></title><p>The branches of the University of Georgia, located at Athens, have a larger attendance than heretofore. The University proper reports a largely increased attendance; the State Normal School has something like 700 students, the annual enrollment promising to exceed anything they have ever had in the past. The State College of Agriculture shows an enrollment this year of 687, against a total enrollment last year of 541. This work is being carried on by a plant originally designed to care for two hundred men. In addition to the students actually enrolled in the college, they serve something like 25,000 people through an extension service and over 200,000 people who are reached through field and miscellaneous meetings.</p></div>

<page id="GA1915.2.P17" no="GA1915.2.20" />

<div><title>TECHNOLOGICAL SCHOOL.<br set="CENTER" /></title><p>At the Technological School in Atlanta, the apprentice class was abolished this year, and the entrance requirements raised from twelve to fourteen units. In spite of the result produced by this factor, there is an increase of thirty over the same date last year. The net total is now 974, and additional enrollments will probaby run the total up to more than 1,000 for the year.</p><p>This school has asked for the sum of $100,000.00 for each of the years 1916 and 1917, being an increase of $10,000.00. This increase is wanted to care for and put into use the magnificent power plant for the school, which is being erected and equipped without one dollar of expense to the State. Through the efforts of the alumni of the institution about $80,000.00 has been raised to erect the buildings for this plant, while the great manufacturers of machinery and material in the North have donated all equipment for the building, valuled at $125,000.00. It would seem, therefore, eminently proper for the General Assembly to appropriate the small annual increase that will enable the institution to utilize this magnificent gift, for the boys of the State who are seeking an industrial education.</p></div><div><title>THE STATE NORMAL SCHOOL.<br set="CENTER" /></title><p>The State Normal School has asked for an appropriation of $4,500.00 for the purpose of building an infirmary at that institution. The Elijah Clark Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution of Athens has offered to donate $700.00, more or less, to be applied on said infirmary, provided the State of Georgia should increase that amount to at least $5,000.00.</p><p>This institution reports that it is now using an old servants' house with only sufficient room to care for four patients at a time. A school that is attended by 700 students is likely at any time to have need of accommodations for many more sick than that. No appropriation has ever been made for this purpose to this institution.</p></div><div><title>THE GEORGIA NORMAL AND INDUSTRIAL COLLEGE.<br set="CENTER" /></title><p>The Georgia Normal and Industrial College at Milledgeville is doing a great work that is limited only by the capacity

<page id="GA1915.2.P18" no="GA1915.2.21" />

of the plant and the financial ability of the school to take care of students. The increase asked for by this institution is much needed and well merited. I would rejoice to see every want of this school met and gratified as I regard it as among the best and greatest of its kind in the Union.</p></div><div><title>THE NORTH GEORGIA AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE AND DISTRICT SCHOOLS.<br set="CENTER" /></title><p>The North Georgia Agricultural College reports that their enrollment is up to capacity, with a very high personnel in the student body. District school reports have been received from the third, fifth, sixth, seventh, ninth and tenth district A.  M. Schools, all showing increased attendance, and indicating that increased support from the State will relieve pressing needs and enable them to do better and more widely extended work. All of these schools have been recently established, nearly all of them starting with some degree of indebtedness which has handicapped their work to a great extent.</p><p>I think that some measure looking to the speedy improvement of these schools will be necessary at an early date. They should be brought closer to the management of the University System of which they are a part, or some agency should be provided in order to secure greater uniformity in the work and a higher degree of efficiency in accomplishment.</p><p>When this is done a substantial increase ought to be made to the income of these schools, properly apportioned.</p></div><div><title>THE COMMON SCHOOLS.<br set="CENTER" /></title><p>The work of the common schools of the State cannot be too earnestly commended to your attention. In the fight waged against illiteracy and ignorance, these schools form the first line of battle, and a proper extension of their work, with improvement in the conditions surrounding the splendid men and women devoting themselves to the business, should be one of the chief concerns of the Legislature.</p><p>I wish the condition of the Treasury was such that you could make a material addition to the present fund, but in

<page id="GA1915.2.P19" no="GA1915.2.22" />

this, and in all other cases, a due regard for the Treasury must not be overlooked.</p><p>It affords me much pleasure to inform you that under the recent Act passed at the regular session of this year, which authorized the borrowing of enough money to meet the annual deficiency in the common school fund, arrangements have been perfected to secure the relief authorized by said measure. The full amount of the appropriation of $2,550,000 has been tendered to the State at a discount of only three per cent. upon warrants covering the same. This splendid offerflattering alike to the credit as well as the honesty of our Statewas made by the Hon. Joseph A. McCord, Governor of the Regional Bank, located in Atlanta. A like offer was also made upon the same terms by the National Park Bank, of New York, our fiscal agent in that city. The warrants have been signed and are now on the way to the parties at interest.</p><p>Unless some unlooked for misfortune should occur it will not be necessary hereafter for the State to postpone the payment of the teachers' salaries in the common schools beyond the day on which they become due.</p><p>This lifts a handicap from our schools, the beneficial effects of which will only be appreciated when the results become known to the people.</p></div><div><title>CONFEDERATE VETERANS.<br set="CENTER" /></title><p>I trust that you will not, in making your appropriations for the coming years, forget the just claims of our Confederate veterans.

There was no very great depreciation in the county returns, owing largely

<page id="GA1915.2.P21" no="GA1915.2.24" />

to the advantageous application of the Tax Equalization Law.</p><p>While the tax rate has been raised in a very slight degree, yet it is hoped for the next year, if the present Legislature is as considerate as your predecessors, there may be a reduction in this rate, so that the people may appreciate the value of the law which seeks to equalize all the burdens of this character among those liable to taxation in the State.</p></div><div><title>THE PROHIBITION LAWS.<br set="CENTER" /></title><p>The failure of the General Assembly to pass on the prohibition measures at the summer session brought about the present extraordinary session.</p><p>It was contended by the majority that the representatives of the people had the right to vote on these matters, and that the use of filibustering tactics to prevent the same was not authorized. I have thought fit, therefore, to include this subject matter in the call, because it seemed to me demanded by the situation itself. The fact that the Legislature would take so extreme a step was an indication of unrest and dissatisfaction throughout the State with the present prohibition laws.</p><p>After the adjournment of the Legislature on August the eleventh, requests, petitions and memorials, both pro and con, began to reach the Governor's office on the subject of including prohibition in the call for the extraordinary session. The number of those urging the inclusion of the subject in the call far exceeded the number of those who opposed the same. Over two-thirds of the membership of the House, and a large majority of the members of the Senate, joined in the request to include the subject, assuring the Executive that proper laws bearing on the subject would be promptly passed at the extra session, should opportunity be given.</p><p>In addition large numbers of petitions were received from grand juries, from church organizations, from civic bodies, from called meetings, public officers and thousands of individual citizens from nearly all the business callings and professions of the State.</p><p>Many poor women connected with no organization made

<page id="GA1915.2.P22" no="GA1915.2.25" />

their pilgrimages from various parts of the State to the Executive office, saying that they were only drunkards' wives, but wanted to add their voices to those of the other friends of temperance throughout the State in behalf of the enactment of these laws.</p><p>I believe it is the sentiment of the great majority of the people of Georgia that some measure should be enacted which will facilitate the enforcement of our prohibition laws. Georgia has occupied a very singular position. While classed among the States having prohibition, yet it is unfortunately the fact that the law has been so loosely administered in various parts of the Commonwealth that the position has become a reproach to the prohibition cause.</p><p>The differences of opinion between the advocates of prohibition and the opponents of the same are so radical that it is doubtful if they could ever be reconciled. Large numbers of our citizens believe that these laws are infringements upon personal liberty. They are, therefore, opposed to them on principle. On the contrary, a still larger number of our people believe that these laws are the surest and best means of aiding the temperance cause among the people, and do not infringe on any vested right of a citizen. They believe that they can be enforced, and if this were done, that the moral, physical and social interests of the State would be greatly improved.</p><p>While the matter was under consideration, a statement was handed the Executive by one of the advocates of prohibition, setting out the results of the law in a State where it seems to be practically enforced, the State of Kansas. This statement was forwarded by me to the Governor of Kansas, where prohibition has been in operation for thirty-five years, and he writes me that same is correct. It says:</p><p><blockquote><p>A half million young men and women in Kansas over twenty-one years of age have never seen a saloon in that State. There is not a Kansas newspaper which publishes a liquor advertisement. Since Kansas adopted prohibition illiteracy has been reduced to less than two per cent. There is only one pauper in every 3,000 population. Eighty-eight of the hundred and five counties have no insane on

<page id="GA1915.2.P23" no="GA1915.2.26" />

county farms, fifty-four no feeble-minded on county farms, and ninety-six no inebriates. Thirty-two poor farms have no inmates. Some counties have not called a jury to try a criminal case in ten years. In one Kansas county, there has not been a grand jury called for twenty-five years.</p></blockquote></p><p>It is needless for me to say to the General Assembly that such statements and publications circulated throughout the country arouse the very greatest enthusiasm among the advocates of prohibition, and it is not surprising in many cases these advocates become so strongly convinced that there appears to them to be no other side to the question. The ideal enforcement of the law is always the object to be sought after. Our own State, for the first six months following the adoption of the prohibition law, furnished a shining example.</p><p>The radical differences of opinion between the advocates of prohibition and the opponents thereof have brought on conflicts at every session of the Legislature for the past five years, and taken up the time of the General Assembly without result or advantage. The valuable time of the legislators has been consumed in an effort to thrash out these questions, concerning which there seems to be no possibility of agreement.</p><p>I concluded, therefore, in obedience to the demands of the Legislature itself, and of a large majority of the people who communicated with me on the subject, that it would be better to settle the matter at an adjourned session if possible, so that the regular session could be taken up with other constructive legislation.</p><p>There were three measures presented worthy of consideration at the recent session, but it is not necessary for the Executive in this message to go into the relative merits of any of the measures that were pending.</p><p>The people demand that more stringent laws should be enacted, so that the benefits of the legislation shall be fully enjoyed by all the inhabitants of the State. The celebrated Webb-Kenyon Act, passed by the National Congress, March 1, 1913, prohibiting the shipment of intoxicating beverages into dry States, and enabling the General Assemblies of

<page id="GA1915.2.P24" no="GA1915.2.27" />

these States to place restrictions upon shipments for personal use, has never yet been adopted in Georgia.</p><p>I most earnestly advise the Legislature to put this Act into immediate operation under such terms and restrictions as shall seem best in your judgment. By doing this, the State authorities will have the co-operation of the National government in the prevention of many of the violations of the prohibition law, and this co-operation, without doubt, can be made effective in preventing the shipment for unlawful purposes into the State of the prohibited articles.</p><p>I think, too, as the sale of liquor in Georgia is not permitted, it would be well to prevent the advertisement of the same, and that this law should go into effect at once.</p><p>It was also proposed at the regular session to repeal the licensing of near beer, locker clubs and such institutions, which the law has made legal since January 1, 1908. In dealing with this matter, it would be proper for the Legislature to give a fair and reasonable time to those engaged in the business for readjusting their affairs and finding other occupations or lines of business, alike for those who are employed in the occupation as for those who own the plants.</p><p>It has been customary in all such cases where the business has been licensed by the State to allow such reasonable time for readjustment. Should the time for the law to take effect be fixed at any period between the first and the last of the fiscal year, it will be necessary that authority be given directly in the Act to prorate the license taxes on a basis according to the time in the fiscal year when the business must cease.</p><p>I have not deemed it necessary to go further into the discussion of the prohibition question. The people of Georgia are trying it out, and I sincerely believe are convinced that if the law can be enforced, it will be of great interest and advantage to the State at large. I agree with them in this belief.</p><p>The question is fast becoming economic with all the governments of the world.

It is believed that after this lease has terminated, the income may be decidedly increased, thus adding materially to the public school fund and to the general assets of the Treasury.</p>

<page id="GA1915.2.P26" no="GA1915.2.29" />

<p>A number of important facts concerning the road have been brought to the attention of my office since I entered upon its duties. Some of these should be considered by you in passing on the questions which the subject will bring before you.</p><p>There is now going on an important proceeding instituted by the Interstate Commerce Commission under the Act of Congress, having for its object the valuation of all the railroad property in the United States. The purpose of this valuation is, among other things, to provide a basis for the fixing of interstate rates on the railroads in the future. That Commission has issued some twenty valuation orders with reference to work required to be done by the owners and operators of railroad propertywhich work is intended to assist the Commission in reaching a final valuation. Fifteen of these orders apply to the Western  Atlantic road. The actual inventory of the road will begin by the government engineers on or about January 1, 1916a little less than two months off.</p><p>The Nashville, Chattanooga  St. Louis Railway Co., the present lessee, has for some months, acting under instructions of the Interstate Commerce Commission, been attempting to comply with the provisions of this valuation law, especially in so far as it involves the ascertainment of the original cost of the property to date, the cost of reproduction new, and the cost of reproduction less depreciation, in addition to the other elements of value going into the property as a whole.</p><p>My predecessor, former Governor Slaton, impressed with the importance of the situation to the people, thought fit to appoint a special engineer in behalf of the State, to aid in this valuation and take care of the State's interests therein. The engineer so appointed served from May 1 to September 15, 1915, and upon notice that he would be unable to continue the work, I left the order in force and appointed Mr. J. H. Johnston to fill his place.</p><p>These special engineers, Messrs. Durham and Johnston, report to me that it will be an exceedingly difficult, if not an utterly impossible, undertaking to ascertain the original cost of the road. They state that none of the books of the road bearing on its construction have been preserved, that

<page id="GA1915.2.P27" no="GA1915.2.30" />

only about twenty or twenty-five per cent. of the original deeds remain, that the maps, made in pursuance of the authority given in the Act of the Legislature of 1895, are utterly incomplete and filled with many discrepancies. They also inform me that it will be a difficult matter to ascertain the cost of reproduction new owing to the fact that in all probability the terminal properties in Atlanta and Chattanooga, when properly assessed, will prove of really more value than the entire line besides. It will be difficult to determine these values definitely, and to do so approximately will require both time and investigation.</p><p>The matter of intangible values must also be considered, franchises, custom, facilities for connectionall these things must go into the subject of valuation, and about which, of course, there can be no mathematical exactness.</p><p>With these conditions urged upon us by our own engineersand with experienced railroad men at variance in their ideas concerning the value of the road, it would seem to follow that the sooner the Legislature takes hold of the matter for final disposition, the better it will be for the interests of all concerned.</p><p>I trust, therefore, that the Legislature at the present session will find it possible to take the preliminary steps necessary to dispose of the road in a manner most profitable to the State. The lessee is now preparing a complete set of maps of the system, the cost of which will run into thousands. I am informed that the State can secure a copy of these maps by expending about $200.00, if application is made therefor in due season.</p><p>The experts of the lessee company are already in the field placing estimates and values upon our property. The experts of the government will soon follow them, and a final valuation soon will be reached upon which will depend very largely the leasing value of the property in the future.</p><p>Judging by the past, it would be best to have some form of commission appointed to take charge of the whole matter. This commission should be required to co-operate with the authorities of the Nashville, Chattanooga  St. Louis Railway Company and the government, in the present valuation work. It should be clothed with such authority as the Legislature may deem proper in reference to the obtaining

<page id="GA1915.2.P28" no="GA1915.2.31" />

and compiling all datathe gathering up of facts and putting the matter in shape for final disposition.</p><p>The members of the commission, if selected outside the legislative body, should be strong, disinterested railroad and business men of unimpeachable integrity and able to comprehend the situation, and just enough to do what is right in the premises.</p><p>I would suggest that it would be advisable to have on this commission the present Chairman of the Railroad Commission of the State, whose wide experience, unimpeachable integrity and unfailing devotion to his State, eminently qualify him to represent her in the leasing of her property.</p><p>Provision should be made for the necessary expenses of the commission, and for the suitable and adequate compensation of the members selected from the State at large.</p><p>I recommend, if such commission is created, that there be embodied in the Act full authority to secure bids for a specified minimum or maximum term of years at a rental to be specified by the bidder. I am not decided whether it would be best to include the minimum rental in the Act.</p><p>I believe it would be better for the State to make a long-term lease, and it ought to be the duty of the commission to look into this, and if a long-term lease is agreed upon, let it be understood that the lessee company will expend the necessary funds for double tracking the road, abolishing the curves, and making other improvements, impossible under a short-term lease. It should be distinctly provided that all such improvements revert to the State at the expiration of the lease.</p><p>I think the question of reimbursing the counties through which the road runs for expense of courts should be considered by the commission, and relief given to the counties aforesaid, inasmuch as no taxes can be levied upon the property.</p><p>The commission should also ascertain whether any portion of the terminal property at either end of the road can be efficiently disposed of without materially decreasing the rental value of the whole.</p><p>I would recommend that this commission report to the regular term of the General Assembly in June, 1916.</p><p>Many considerations concur in bringing about a belief on

<page id="GA1915.2.P29" no="GA1915.2.32" />

the part of the Executive that the present is the best and most opportune time to consider the matter of re-leasing the road at a figure that will be just to the State and secure its highest interests for the future.</p><p>I have outlined my ideas of the powers with which the commission should be clothed merely as suggestions to your body, for I know you have investigated the subject carefully at the recent term and it seems to me you should be able to reach a conclusion at an early date without any great discussion or difference of opinion concerning the same.</p></div><div><title>STATE WAREHOUSE SYSTEM.<br set="CENTER" /></title><p>I am convinced that the time has arrived when some proper legislation is needed to authorize a more adequate warehouse system for our farm products. The following is the result which should be sought:</p><p><list><item><p>First. The removal from our cotton producers of the necessity of marketing their crop as fast as gathered.</p></item><item><p>Second. The giving of encouragement to those planting and harvesting other crops than cotton so that the farmers of the State may raise a necessary food supply, with a reasonable expectation of having a steady market, and the ability to handle such products on as good terms as they can handle cotton.</p></item></list></p><p>The details of this proposed legislation have been studied by many members of the General Assembly, and I have thought it worth while to include it in the call for the extraordinary session.</p><p>I recognize the fact that there will be differences of opinion as to what is the best method of handling the situation, but I have no hesitation in calling on the Legislature to examine carefully into the matter and see if some remedy cannot be applied to meet the present unsatisfactory situation.</p><p>Cotton has always been Georgia's foremost money crop, and it will, beyond every doubt, continue to be so for many years to come. This great staple, first planted in Georgia in Seventeen Hundred and Thirty-four, has grown in importance until today it turns into our coffers annually approximately two hundred millions of dollars.</p>

<page id="GA1915.2.P30" no="GA1915.2.33" />

<p>The process of cultivating the crop has been improved. The process of separating the lint from the seed has undergone a vast change. The process of manufacturing the raw lint into the finished product has undergone a change still more phenomenal; and yet today, we have practically about the same mode of marketing our crop as was in vogue a half century ago.</p><p>It is an undisputed fact that no system devised by man can be deemed to be perfect. It stands to reason, therefore, that our present antiquated system can be improved, and it remains for you gentlemen, as representatives of your people, to say whether these improvements are to be made under State supervision.</p><p>It will be a glorious day for Georgia when her sturdy sons, the very backbone of the State, upon whom we all depend for our sustenance and wealth, can know that their warehouse receipts mean ready cash without a forced sale. The banks, in the time of need, have the notes of the merchants to secure them; the merchants have the notes of the farmers as collateral; the farmer has no security to offer and, consequently, is perhaps forced to throw his crop upon the market at a ruinous price.</p><p>We find upon every hand, the great crying need of today is for better credit facilities for the farmers, that they may go forward, feed and clothe the world, and enrich themselves by their industry.</p><p>Should we adopt a warehouse system and make it possible for the farmer to secure a reduced interest rate on his products, I am told that this would probably form a valuable aid to our rural credits system, to which this General Assembly has pledged itself.</p><p>The small farmer who has no land would certainly be benefitted, and the large farmer who has much land would have an additional advantage added to the rural credit system we are earnestly hoping to obtain.</p><p>The interest of the farmer has been the football of politics for a long time. I believe the end has come, and that the people do not desire more of this.</p><p>The law should provide that all warehouses of the State should be eligible to qualify under the rules provided for securing the end in question, and if this can be done without

<page id="GA1915.2.P31" no="GA1915.2.34" />

unnecessary expense or hardship we will not be troubled with the fear of concentrating the cotton crop in certain localities, rather than handling it at the point of production.</p><p>I have included the matter in the present call, because it was represented to me that it was an emergency measure, that it would be necessary to have some law enacted if it was expected to get the system in operation by time of the marketing of the crop in 1916.</p><p>If the legislation can be carefully drawn, guarded at all points, made not too cumbrous or complicated it seems to me that it would eventually prove to be one of the most beneficial pieces of constructive legislation enacted in many years.</p><p>I have always contended that the people of the South can raise cotton better than any other people on earth. Their lands are also fitted for grain and food-stuff. If the two crops could be developed together by the farmers, our prosperity would soon attain to the highest possible point of perfection. It would be easy to diversify the crops of Georgia if the storing and marketing facilities of other States were afforded.</p><p>I have been thus careful in calling this matter to your attention, because I am persuaded that it will not be an easy task to so adjust the legislation to meet the precise wants of the farmer, banker and warehouseman.</p><p>Unless there is unanimity as to the form of the legislation touching the subject when you begin its consideration, and unless you feel assured that you can at this time enact a measure that will be satisfactory to the people, and accomplish the desired results, then I suggest that you refer the whole matter to a committee to be appointed from the two houses, who shall report their conclusions to the next session of the Legislature, with the appropriate, proposed legislation accompanying same.</p></div><div><title>PROTECTION OF FISH, OYSTERS, SHRIMP AND PRAWN.<br set="CENTER" /></title><p>Section 612, Volume 2, of the Code of Georgia of 1910, makes it a misdemeanor to catch or take any fish with seine, net, gig or spear, or like device from any of the

waters of this State, between the first day of February and the first day of July in each year, except with hook and line. While shrimp and prawn are classed as fish, it might well be held that this section was not intended to apply to them as they are not susceptible of being caught with hook and line. As the process of catching them in nets, however, involves the catching of quite a large number of scale fish which are undoubtedly covered by the section, a technical violation of the law must necessarily result from the use of nets in order to take shrimp or prawn.</p><p>A large industry in the taking and shipping of these fish has grown up within the past few years in the coast counties of the State. I am informed that these industries support some 10,000 people at this time and are rapidly growing. I am also informed that a closed season for fish or prawn from May first to August first of each year would give abundant protection to almost every species of fish including shrimp and prawn, during the entire spawning period. The time of greatest activity for the taking of shrimp and prawn seems to be from January first to May first and the strict enforcement of the Code section above referred to would entail great hardship upon the people engaged in this industry, without corresponding benefit to the natural fish supply.</p><p>I commend to your consideration the bill that was introduced in the Senate at the summer session, which passed that body by an almost unanimous vote, and which not only changes the closed season in accordance with the above statement, but provides for the preservation of our natural resources in fish and oysters, affording a revenue that will meet the necessary expense for carrying out these provisions and furnishing a surplus for the school fund of the State.</p><p>The measure referred to was originally prepared by experts on the subject from the coast counties of Georgia and from the Bureau of Fisheries at Washington, who had before them the experience of other States in these matters.</p><p>I am informed that this bill is satisfactory to the parties concerned and I bespeak for this measure your careful consideration, not only for the benefit of the people interested in the industries themselves, but for the good of the State

It is the subject of litigation in other forums, and the case is now pending in the Supreme Court that will doubtless settle the question of constitutionality.</p><p>I have included the question as one of the objects in the extraordinary call, because of the possibility of the court's contention being sustained, which result would cause the loss of approximately $120,000.00 in the revenue of the State.</p><p>If the law is declared unconstitutional, it would also put an end to an important and necessary regulation on the part of the State in regard to these vehicles.</p><p>It will be noticed that there is no provision made for the enforcing of this tax, the good faith of the taxpayer being largely concerned in the matter.</p><p>I respectfully suggest to the General Assembly the advisability of investigating the subject, and of making such amendments to the law as would meet the contention of those who claim the tax to be invalid. This, as I understand, can be done so as to sustain the present tax levy.</p><p>The fund is now divided among the several counties in proportion to the road mileage of those counties.
