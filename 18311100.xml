It does not appear to your committee, so far as the people of Georgia are concerned, at all necessary, to enter into a defence of this measure of the Government. Our people with

<page id="GA1831.1.P266" no="GA1831.1.267" />

one accord, your committee believe, approve both the policy of the law and the manner of its enforcement. The policy of the State toward the Cherokee tribe of Indians, in regard to the unsettled lands within her limits, and particularly in reference to the missionaries who have made themselves obnoxious to the penalty of the act of the last Legislature; has been and still is already [abroad] the subject of misrepresentation, and the theme of vituperation. We have been represented, as usurping rights, which belong to the Indians, as exercising dominion over a people, free and independent, and as disregarding the sacred character and holy functions of the missionaries of the Cross. A regard to the moral sense of the people of the Union, and a just respect to the character of the State, your committee believe, require, that, upon this subject facts should be exhibited, and the principles of action, which have governed the State should be well understood.</p><p>By a law of the State, passed at the last session of the General Assembly, all white persons, except agents of the United States, are prohibited from residing within its territory, occupied by the Cherokees, unless authorised by license from the Governor or his agent, upon taking an oath to support the constitution and laws of this State. The right of the State to pass this law, results as a necessary consequence, to the right which she has to the soil and jurisdiction, over the Cherokee landsHer right of jurisdiction is co-extensive with her chartered limits and embraces the persons and things, within those limits. No enlightened jurist of the present day, no one familiar with the custom, which has governed all the states of the Union, who have had Indian tribes within their limits, or who is conversant with the policy of the Federal Government, since the administration of Mr. Monroe, will for a moment doubt, the right of the State, to extend her criminal laws over the whole of her chartered limits: this is not a vexed question: at all events, its elucidation does not constitute a part of the duty of your committee upon the present occasion.</p><p>The reason and necessity of the law, are as obvious as the right to enact it. A leading object with the General Government has been, for many years, the removal of the Cherokee Indians West of the Mississippi. This has been held by the most benevolent, and also the most distinguished of our statesmen, the only means left to the Government to save the [Illegible Text] remnants of this once numerous and powerful nation, from moral [Illegible Text] as individuals; and total extinction as a tribe. Year after year, the tribes within the states, have been seen to decrease in numbers, and to sink lower and lower

<page id="GA1831.1.P267" no="GA1831.1.268" />

in crime, depravity, and sin. The parental arm of the Government has been extended to their relief, and the Federal and State Governments, have united their efforts to remove them from their present habitations and locate them beyond the Mississippi. There, under the protection of the Government, and free, alike from the crimes and the [Illegible Text] of the white man, to live in their own peculiar way, the happy and lordly masters of the Forest.</p><p>It was an object of peculiar interest to Georgia, to acquire a speedy possession of her Cherokee lands. Too long had the Government delayed to liquidate the Indian possession. She had become justly jealous of her rights, and her people had become impatient of the restraints imposed by the delay of the Federal Government to fulfil her treaty obligations. The Cherokee tribe had assumed the attitude of an independent nation, with government and laws distinct from, and independent of the State authority. The discovery of immense mineral wealth, within the limits of the nation, acting upon the avarice and cupidity of men, had brought into the territory, a numerous body of men, lawless, abandoned, and hostile to the policy of the State. These circumstances imperiously asked of the State decisive and prompt action, and on these [Illegible Text] she enacted laws, abrogating the Cherokee Government, making it penal to dig gold, and punishing a resident within the territory, unless the resident would take an oath to observe the constitution and laws of the state. The exclusion of all white persons from the Cherokee lands, was the dictate of policy and necessity. It was well ascertained that the efforts of whites resident in the nation, were directed to a prevention of the removal of the Indians. They dissuaded the Indians from emigrating, encouraged them in their ideas of independence, misrepresented the policy and intents of the Government, and thwarted, by all the means within their power, the views of the state. It became necessary, therefore, that the state should abandon her policy and cease her efforts to remove the Indians, or rid herself of the selfish and corrupt whites, who had settled among them.Hence the passage of the act, making it penal to reside within the limits of the land occupied by the Cherokees, without a license, and without taking an oath to observe the constitution and laws of the state. The oath and the license, it was thought, would be a sufficient protection of the policy of the state, from any attempts to defeat it, by such as might think proper to remain. To such as were well disposod to the benevolent views of the State, the oath would be no stumbling block, whilst it would exclude such as were hostile to her interests and her policy. And the [Illegible Text] of permitting a

<page id="GA1831.1.P268" no="GA1831.1.269" />

residence there, upon such terms, proves conclusively that the law was intended to operate upon such only as were defeating the [Illegible Text] objects of the state. Removal of the whites was not so much desired, as the destruction of that influence, which was at war with the interest of Georgia.</p><p>It is worthy of remark, that the Federal Government, acting <i>in loco parentis</i> to the Indians, delegated to her Indian agents more power over whites, resident in the nation, than Georgia seeks to exercise, in the enforcement of her law. They were instructed, by order from the War Department in the following words: You are to allow no white person to enter and [Illegible Text] on the Indian lands within your agency, who shall not on entering present to you, approved testimonials of his good character for industry, honesty, and sobriety; nor then, without the consent of the Indians. And if, after permission is given under such testimonials, the person or persons to whom it is given, shall become lazy, dishonest, intemperate, or in any way setting vicious examples before the Indians, exciting them against each other, or <i>inflaming their jealousy</i> and <i>suspicion against</i> the <i>General Government,</i> or any of its <i>acts towards them,</i> or attempting to degrade in their eyes the agents of government, thereby destroying their influence over the Indians by false accusations or otherwise, you will forthwith order such person or persons out of the Indian country.It is here seen, that Georgia in her sovereign character, and in the exercise of an indubitable right, has scarcely assumed as much power over these persons, as the Federal Government thought proper to commit to her agents, who were to a great extent irresponsible. Both governments had mainly in view the same object, in the suppression of any influence among the Indians, adverse to their benevolent designs towards them, and yet not a few of those who admit and justify the measures of the General Government, condemn and reprobate the law of this state. Your committee are of opinion that when this matter is understood, it will be admitted that all which Georgia has done, was made necessary in order to effect the removal of the Indians.</p><p>Let those too who clamor so much about Indian rights, and who weep so much over Indian sufferings, know, that this law was necessary to the protection of the persons and property of the Indians from the violence, the intrigues, and the corruptions of the whites. Here it is well understood, that white men are the greatest enemies to the Indians, whether in the character of the selfish, avaricious and ambitious resident within their limits, or the character of the political

<page id="GA1831.1.P269" no="GA1831.1.270" />

knave, or canting fanatic without their limits. At no time have Indian rights been [Illegible Text] protected, and at no time has the Cherokee tribe exhibited more evidence of peace, quiet, and protection, than since the extension of our laws over them. The Georgia jurisdiction has been their shield. Not only so, but the law exeluding the whites, was intended to extend, and does now extend, protection to those who are willing to evade its penalties, by complying with its terms. The laws and character of the state, are a guarantee to such, of more right, than they ever enjoyed there. By a strange perversion of principle, or a wretched ignorance of facts, a mild and benevolent policy has been corrupted into the veriest despotismand that law, which created a right for the white man in the Cherokee country, which he had not before, and protected him in the enjoyment of it, has been denounced as arbitrary, unjust, and unholy. At no time, under the intercourse laws, have the Indians been so effectually protected, and at so little cost as under the laws of Georgia. Your committee have said, that the act of the General Assembly was necessary to carry into effect the benign policy of the State, in reference to the Indians, that it operated as a protection to them, from the rapacity and violence of the whites, and that so far from its being an unwarrantable proscription of them, it actually conferred privileges which, of right, they have not before possessed. The latter position is made manifest by adverting to the fact, that before the passage of the act, no white citizen could claim his residence there as a matter of right; but the moment he complied with the reasonable requisitions of the law, he became [Illegible Text] facto entitled to such residence and all the benefits it conferred. It is true, that many were upon the soil at the moment of passing the act, but their residence was assumed, and only tolerated by the State: they were only residents at the sufferance of the State. The missionaries themselves will not deny but that their condition, in the Cherokee nation, under the jurisdiction of Georgia, was greatly preferable to what it was under the dominion of the agents of the United States.</p><p>The law which has excited so much feeling among our brethren of the eastern states, is not partial or exclusive in its operation. The first citizen of Georgia, the most abandoned of the refugee adventurers for gold, as well as the meek and law abiding Moravian missionary, are within its provisionsall classes, all grades, and all professions are alike liable to its penalties. Our law in this, as well as all [other] cases, aims at no individual or individuals, and recognises no exemptions. And had the most talented, or the

<page id="GA1831.1.P270" no="GA1831.1.271" />

most dignified of our sons, [Illegible Text] within the [Illegible Text] of our lands in the possession of the Cherokee Indians, without having taken the oath; the law would have been administered upon such an one, with unsparing rigor and [Illegible Text] severity. Your committee, therefore, declare that no objection can be urged against the state, with any propriety, upon the score of its [Illegible Text], for the state made all men equal under the law.</p><p>The law of the last Legislature, herein adverted to, did not, according to its provisions, take effect immediately.The commencement of its operation was fixed, at a time sufficiently remote to put all persons interested upon their guard; and [Illegible Text] opportunity was afforded, for a knowledge of its existence and of its provisions. No man was entrapped, and all who offended against it sinned against the authority of the state, with a perfect knowledge of the consequences. Most of those persons who were residents of the Cherokee country either removed from the state or submitted to the requirements of the law. The Board of Directors of the United Brethren's mission at Salem, believing that the object of their mission to the Cherokees, under the [Illegible Text] circumstances of the state, and the Indians, could not be effected, instructed their missionaries to remove from the country. Acting, as your committee believe, from a sense of respect to the laws and authorities of Georgia, they were unwilling to interfere with her laws or her policy. In the conduct of these [Illegible Text] and devoted missionaries of the Cross, is exhibited in bold relief the pure and sublime principles of our [Illegible Text] religion. Some there were, however, who refused to remove from our limits and who refused to comply with the conditions of residence prescribed in the law. These individuals were either missionaries or persons who were under their influence and acted under their advisement. The most conspicuous and talented of these individuals, are the Rev. S. Worcester and Dr. E. Butler, missionaries of the American Board of Foreign Missions.</p><p>These persons had long been conversant with the policy of the General Government, and with the rights as well as the laws of Georgia. The law, to whose penalty they became obnoxious, was known to them. The law had raised within their hearing, its warning voice, and admonished them of their duty; but the Governor of the State, reluctant to enforce upon them, the penalty of the law, respecting their sacred profession, and respecting still more the most holy cause in which they were engaged; kindly and politely, and

<page id="GA1831.1.P271" no="GA1831.1.272" />

in the spirit of forbearance, warned them, yet again of their crime and invited them away from their own ruin. A personal address was made to each of them by his Excellency, and ten days given for their removalall this did not avail. They not only persisted in their illegal residence, but ventured upon justification of their crime in an address to the Executive of the State. Orders were then given to arrest them, that they might [Illegible Text] the full penalty of our laws since such was their voluntary choice. They were arrested, tried and convicted, and now inmates of the State-Prison, they suffer the melancholy doom which their perverse obstinacy, or misguided zeal has brought upon them.</p><p>What reproach could be cast upon the State for their conviction, and what justification or extenuation can be had for their violation of the laws of the State? None. No man would hesitate to pronounce them the wilful perpetrators of their own misfortunes. If it be said that they were residents upon those lands by permission of the United States Government, and therefore the State had no right to punish them; your committee answer, that the Government of the United States, has no power to bestow a right, which is adverse to the rights of Georgia, and that this permission was good to them so long as the State acquiesced in it, and no longer; and the enacting of the law, making the residence criminal, is a declaration of the State's dissent to it. If it is [Illegible Text] that their residence was by permission of the Indians and therefore the State could not make it penal,your committee answer; the Indians, it is true have a right of occupancy; but this right of occupancy is personal to themselves, and cannot be by them delegated, to any person whatever: therefore their consent to a residence is no justification. The ultimate fee to the lands, is in Georgia, and so far as Georgia and all the world (except the Indians) is concerned, she is the alsolute, unqualified owner.As your committee before remarked, the right of jurisdiction is in Georgia, and of consequence there is no limit to her right of penal enactment. The state owned the lands, and it was perfectly competent for her, to prescribe such terms to residence upon them, as she deemed fit and expedient. It will not be denied that the State has the right to prescribe such conditions to a residence, upon the state-house square in the town of Milledgeville, as she may think fit. So far as all the world, except the Indians, is concerned, there is no difference between the title, which the State has to her state-house square, and her title to the Cherokee lands. In either case the grant is in her, and can never be divested but by her own act. If it. is said that the State did require the Missionaries to take an oath, which in

<page id="GA1831.1.P272" no="GA1831.1.273" />

conscience they could not take, or suffer the penalty of the law; your committee answer, that the State involved the Missionaries in no such desperate dilemma. If the oath was taken, it was a voluntary act, and the oath could have been avoided by removal from our limits. If the penalty was suffered, it was a voluntary act; which might have been avoided either by taking the oath, or removing from the limits. The Missionaries were left free to choose between the oath the penalty of the law, and removal, and they choose the penalty of the law. Why then should the State be censured for an act, which was the result of choice, on the part of the missionaries? and which your committee fear was sought by them, either for the purposes of political effect, or to exhibit themselves to a sympathising fraternity, as [Illegible Text] for righeousness' sake?</p><p>They surely cannot claim for themselves exemption from the operation of the laws of the State, by reason of their profession or their vocation. The laws of Georgia interfere not with the religious privileges, or conscientious opinions of menand the State lends her aid to all efforts, for the dissemination of the truths of revelation, she is the auxiliary of the missionary, in teaching the Heathen, the great truths of Christianity; and her constitution and laws are based upon the principles and doctrines of him who spake as never man spake. Still the law is no respecter of personsand he who violates it, whether Jew or Gentile, Christian or [Illegible Text], Mahometan or Pagan, must expect to meet its sanctions and feel its penalties. It is for the missionaries to reconcile their precepts with their practice, and to prove to the world, that the religion which they profess allows, much less encourages, disobedience to laws, insubordination, and resistance to the powers that be It remains for them to show, that resistance to rightful [Illegible Text] authority is either a Christian duty, or a Christian privilegethat things which are C[aelig]sar's, are not to be rendered to C[aelig]sar, and that conscientious scruples can defeat the operation of laws, or stay the hand of Government. If the opinion of every subject, as to the constitutionality of the laws under which he lives, can exempt him from their operation, then is Government a mockery, and lawgivers, Judges and Governors, the merest toys to be sported with according to the whims and caprices of individuals. In the letters of these individuals to the Governor, the reason of their refusal to obey the laws of Georgia, is assigned to be, that they did not believe the State had the right of jurisdiction over the country, and believing as they did, they could not do violence to their consciences by taking the oath. Your committee believe, that scruples as to the oath, should

<page id="GA1831.1.P273" no="GA1831.1.274" />

have removed all scruples as to their duty to remove. They cannot deny the right of all men, to judge for themselves, of the constitutionality, or propriety of any law; but it is a new idea, that the law as to such an one so judging, is to fail of its effect and become a nullity. Those who do assume this original, natural right, and act upon it, as the missionaries have done, must expect to suffer as they are suffering, the consequences of their rash judgment.</p><p>The Rev. Samuel A. Worcester and Dr. Elizur Butler, were warned of the existence of the law they have violated. They were politely invited to remove and time given for their removal. They resisted the authority of the State, and repelled with disdain, the kind offices of the Governor in their behalf. They were arrested, defended by enlightened counsel, tried before a court distinguished for its legal wisdom and its benevolent feeling, and convicted and sentenced. Still the authority of the State followed them with anxious solicitude to relieve them, still kindness and mercy and forbearance, would have stayed the execution of the sentence. At the Gate of the Penitentiary, they were met with the offer of pardon, upon the easy terms of removal from the territory, or taking the oath. This offer they repelledThese overtures of mercy they heeded not, and entered the Penitentiary, a living monument of fanaticism, political knavery, or egregions folly.Notwithstanding <i>all these things,</i> Georgia has been ranked among the Despotisms of the East, and her late benevolent, honest and talented Governor, placed among the Neros, Dionysiuses and Dracos of infamous memory. From the enlightened, the candid and the pious of all parties and all creeds, the State must receive a judgment not only of acquital of error or crime, but of high commendation.</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That this committee recommend, and do hereby recommend to the General Assembly, the printing of forty copies of this report, for each member of the State Delegation in Congress, and that his Excellency the Governor, be, and he is hereby requested to forward to our Delegation in Congress, forty copies each of the report.</p><p>Read and agreed to.</p><p>THOMAS STOCKS, President.</p><p>Attest, I.

By the account current accompanying the report, it appears, that the Commissioners have had in disposable funds, including Bank

Stock, thirteen thousand nine hundred and one dollars and forty-two cents, and that they have expended thirteen thousand four hundred and ninety-eight dollars and thirty-seven cents, leaving a balance in the hands of the Commissioners, of four hundred and three dollars and five cents. The agent remarks, that the balance against the Commissioners, consists chiefly in notes, accounts and attorney's receipts, mostly on insolvent persons, and all barred by the statute of limitations, and that he was informed by Col. Blount, that no part of the same had been collected. The agent also states, that he has inspected a list of these debts, a copy of which is appended to his report, marked number thirty, that they correspond in amount and description with those mentioned in the report of eighteen hundred and twenty-four, that they are in his opinion the same, and that they are the only bad debts which accumulated in the hands of the commissioners during their service. Admitting that the commissioners have done all that could have been reasonably expected of them, in the collection of these debts, there would be a balance in their favor, of one hundred and forty eight dollars and forty-two cents, but this they do not even assert, nor does it appear that all of the above mentioned debts were bad, so that the committee cannot assume the settlement to be complete until those evidences of debts are more satisfactorily accounted for, and in no event in the opinion of the committee could the commissioners rightfully charge the State more than the amount of the funds placed in their hands, though it is the opinion of the committee under the circumstances as they are presented in the report of the agent, that a further prosecution of the settlement with the Commissioners would only result in expense to the State, without any corresponding benefit.</p><p>The public hands under the control of the Commissioners, have been accounted for to the satisfaction of the committee.</p><p>It appears by the report of Mr. Hines, made to the late Governor, and acted on by the last Legislature, that Col.

<law id="R1831V1N215" initial.page="280"><p>IN SENATE, December 22, 1831.</p><p>The joint committee on Banks, to whom was referred the annual statement of the condition of the Central Bank, respectfully <i>report,</i> that they have thoroughly investigated the offices [affairs] of that institution, the result of which has been entirely satisfactory. The evidences of debt to the Bank; the bills of other banks owned by the Central Bank; the bills of that Bank, and the amount of specie in its vault, were all found to correspond with the report referred to your committee. The issues of the bank have been within the established limits; the discounts have been properly distributed to the several counties of the State, and the sums allowed to individuals have not exceeded the amounts authorised by law. The ability, intelligence, industry and zeal, of the Directors and officers of the bank, have been every where manifested in their several departments, and in the discharge their various, arduous and responsible, and frequently delicate duties. Whatever may be the difference of opinion prevailing, as to the policy of such an institution, all who will make themselves acquainted with the manner in which the complicated and diversified duties that by law have devolved upon the Central Bank, have been discharged, must accord to those who have directed its affairs, an entire approbation. Whilst the Central Bank shall be conducted in the same [Illegible Text], and managed with the same ability that have characterised its present administration, the public, for whose use it has been established must feel that much will be done in the collection of the public revenue, and the [Illegible Text] of [Illegible Text] sound currency, at the same time that a large addition will be made to the annual income of the State.</p><p>The notes of the Central Bank in circulation, amount to one hundred and eleven thousand nine hundred and ninety-six dollars. To meet these there has been provided a fund consisting of eighty thousand six hundred and fifty-six dollars in specie, fifty thousand eight hundred and five dollars in bills of the United States Bank and Branches, and one hundred and eight thousand six hundred and fifty-three dollars in the notes of the State Banks.</p><p>It is respectfully represented by your committee that the salary of the Cashier is wholly inadequate to his services, duties, and responsibilities. There is no economy more efficient and judicious than that which declares the labourer worthy of his hire; and which gives a full reward that a full

service may be exacted. A resolution is [Illegible Text] authorising an increase of the pay of this officer.</p><p>There are in possession of the the Central Bank a number of notes, given by individuals, for the purchase of fractions, at varlous periods, whose places of residence are unknown. If some efficient measure be not adopted, these notes cannot be collected. It has been thought that if they were authorised to be placed in the hands of some proper agent, who should be allowed a liberal [Illegible Text] for searching out the principals and securities, and collecting the amounts due, that something might yet be collected which otherwise must be lost to the State. A resolution giving that power to the Directors of the Central Bank, is herewith submitted. There are in possession of the Central Bank mutilated bills of its own amounting to five thousand dollars, which your committee recommend be burned: for that purpose a resolution is herewith submitted.</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That the salary of the cashier of the Central Bank be raised to two thousand dollars.</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That the Directors of the Central Bank be authorised to place in the hands of competent agents, for collection, such notes as they may have, whose drawers and securities, or whose places of residence are unknown; and that such per cent. be allowed upon all monies that may be collected from such persons as to the said Directors may appear proper.</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That the mutilated notes of the Central Bank, now in its possession, be burnt, in the presence of the committee on banks or its sub-committee.</p><p>The committee on banks, has the honor to <i>report</i> that, on an examination of the annual report of the President of the Marine and Fire Insurance Company, it appears that the affairs of the institution have been managed judiciously, and with a due regard to the interest of the stockholders. The amount of specie and funds, which may be converted into specie, are ample, and would meet any demand which could be made upon the bank. The committee is satisfied with the state of the institution, and believe it fully entitled to the confidence of the public.</p><p>The following report of the bank committee on the condition of the Darien Bank, to wit: That the statement of the Bank of Darien shows a sound and healthy condition; it has [Illegible Text] semi annual dividends, which have lately brought

into the coffers of the State, the sum of twenty-one thousand one hundred and twenty-five dollars. The steady course which it has pursued for some years part, has had a tendency to redeem its former character, and place it amongst the cherished institutions of the State; more especially as it now possesses the confidence of the public and shares its patronage.</p><p>The joint committee to whom was referred the annual statements of the condition of the Bank of the State of Georgia, of the Darien Bank, of the Savings Bank of Augusta, and of the Augusta Insurance and Banking Company, <i>Report:</i> That the statement of the Bank of the State of Georgia, as exhibited by the accompanying account current, shows the said Bank and its branches to be in a sound condition, and that they deserve a continnance of that full confidence hitherto placed in them by the public.</p><p>The report of the Augusta Saving Bank, from the commencement of its business to the present time, gives a detailed statement of its operations. This differs from ordinary banks: its object is essentially charitable, and with its benevolence it affords to the improvident practical lessons on economy; it holds out no invitation to the capitalist or office holder [hunter.] The management of this institution reflects honour upon its philanthropic directors; and in confirmation of the disinterestedness with which it has been managed, it is shown that its expenses, from the commencement of its operations to the present time, nearly three years, amount to only twenty two dollars and seventy four cents.</p><p>The statement of the Augusta Insurance and Banking Company exhibits available means, on brief notice, adequate to all current demands. The promptitude with which it settled [its] late uncommon losses, entitle it to the highest praise.</p><p>As the Augusta Insurance and Banking Company, under the privileges of its charter, both issues bills and insures on property, the committee would have been better satisfied, if its statement had been accompanied with the amount of its risks on insurance; for in addition to its bank liabilities, it is equally bound to meet losses on insurances.</p><p>The committee on banks, to whom was referred the annual statement of the Bank of Augusta, beg leave to <i>report,</i> That on a careful and minute examination of the exhibits, they find such evidence of the ability with which the affairs of the bank have been conducted, and of its sound and stable

condition, that notwithstanding the great depreciation in the real estate belonging to that institution, of about twenty-nine thousand dollars, and in doubtful and bad debts to the amount of twenty-four thousand [dollars;] yet your committee are of opinion that this bank is in a prosperous and flourishing condition, and without, [withal] that the ability and fidelity with which its affairs have been managed, meets the approbation of your committee, and as such is entitled to the entire confidence of the Legislature and of the people of Georgia.</p><p>The committee on banks, to whom was referred the annual statement and condition of the Planters Bank of the State of Georgia, respectfully <i>Report,</i> That after a mature and careful examination into the fiscal concerns of said Bank, your committee are fully of opinion that the condition of said institution, and the management thereof, as to its pecuniary concerns, is highly satisfactory to your committee, and deserves the confidence of the Legislature and the public at large.</p><p>The committee on banks, to whom was referred the report of the bank of Columbus, beg leave to <i>report,</i> That after a due examination on the condition of said bank, they find nothing in the management of the affairs of said institution, which does not warrant your committee in saying that the institution has been well conducted, and in a sound condition, and is entitled to the fullest confidence of the Legislature and of the people of Georgia.</p><p>The committee to whom was referred the annual exhibit of the condition of the Merchants and Planters Bank of Angusta, respectfully <i>report,</i> That after such an examination into the condition furnished by said bank, your committee are of the opinion that the affairs of that institution, as to its pecuniary concerns, is entirely sound, and merits the confidence and patronage of the Legislature and the public generally.</p><p>The joint committee on banks, to whom was referred an extract of the minutes of the Central Bank of Georgia, in relation to the claim of Col. Seaborn Jones, beg leave respectfully to <i>report,</i> That they have had the same under consideration, and from all the information that they have been enabled to collect upon the subject, they cannot but believe that the course pursued by the officers of the Central Bank, with regard to this subject, is perfectly correct. Your committee, from information, find that Col. Seaborn Jones received

the appointment of the States's agent, to settle a contract entered into between the State and Col. Bedney Franklin, relative to the collection of certain debts, then due the state, and that Col. Jones received the sum of forty-four thousand four hundred and ninety-three dollars, seventy-five and three-fourth cents, and paid into the treasury forty-two thousand four hundred and fifty-two dollars and fifty one cents, retaining as his fee two thousand and forty one dollars twenty-four and three-fourth cents, which your committee believe to be ample compensation for the services rendered, and therefore believe the claim of Col. Jones to be unreasonable and ought not to be granted.</p><p>The joint committee on banks, giving the utmost credit to those who manage the Macon Bank, and placing the most liberal construction on their annual statements, feel authorised to say the institution is able to redeem all the bills it has in circulation, and its issues in bills do no not exceed the amount which strict banking principles allow.</p><p>Read and agreed to.</p><p><i>In the House of Representatives,</i></p><p>THOMAS STOCKS, President.</p><p>Attest, I.

A detailed report on these several subjects would involve the committee in a prolixity

<page id="GA1831.1.P284" no="GA1831.1.285" />

incompatible with legislation. Some consideration is deemed necessary to each, and the more especially, as occasional notices of the condition of the literature of the State, as provided by law, may awaken an increased zeal in the community at large on the important subject of education.</p><p>In our country every man ought to prepare himself for taking a part in her public busines. Should be never aspire to a seat in her State or National Councils, he yet owes it as a duty to himself and his posterity, to let any talent he may possess appear at least in her primary assemblies.</p><p>If this view of our duty be correct, and it is believed it cannot be controverted, the committee feel warranted in considering the subject of education, the noblest and most im portant that can engage the attention of the lawgiver, it lies, in truth, at the basis of the whole social system. It affects not only the individual happiness, the character and the usefulness of those who are its objects, but it exerts a most powerful and irresistible influence upon the government, the laws, and the liberties of communities. No nation when the majority of the people is well educated, can remain enslaved; no nation when the great mass is ignorant can retain its freedom. In proportion to the general intelligence will be the force, the wealth, and the influence of a State, and it will be respected in the exact ratio of the instructed talent it can bring into its negociations.</p><p>The committee regret to say, that they have seen strong indications of a belief that more of learning than will suffice for the pursuits prescribed by parents and guardians, or than is absolutely demanded in the contemplated profession, is worse than useless. Divines have deprecated the use of mere human learning in their noviciatesPhysicians sneered at by their fellows, because they were Chemists and ZoologistsLawyers less patronized because they were scholarsMerchants who refused liberally educated men as clerks; and parents who have prohibited the study of the ancient languages and Mathematics to boys intended for the counting-house. The great cry in considering systems of education is, where is the good? The ends are always mistaken for the means; and it seems almost universally to be forgotten, that elementary education is far less intended to qualify for any specific pursuit; than to give that development of mental powers and energy, which may lead to usefulness in any, and lay the foundation of greatness in that for which the peculiar bent of the genius is calculated. Objections like these are too common to be disregarded, and can be removed only by a general diffusion of intelligence. No one who has [Illegible Text] studied Mathematics can fail to have remarked the improvement

<page id="GA1831.1.P285" no="GA1831.1.286" />

of those of his powers which are adapted to mercantile life. The whole subject of compound interest. The compensation of chances on which every species of insurance is founded. The real principles of stock operations. The arbitration of exchanges may be treated mathematically, and in this way alone any valuable and practical result can be derived. The last of these is not yet an object of business in this country; but the time is approaching, when [in] intelligent hands it will be the surest and safest mode of employing capital.</p><p>No one who has watched the manner in which duty is performed, by those who are in possession of mental resources to fill the hours of idleness, and by those who must for a want of other objects of interest apply their waste time to dissipation, would hesitate between an educated and an ignorant clerk. Who that has compared the close and pertinent reasoning of the well education [educated] and learned Barrister would hesitate, which to choose for his counsel? Who that knows the powerful effects of Chemical affinities upon the substances employed as remedies, and the vast complexity of the human machine, would intrust his life to the Physician who could not judge for himself of the chemical, physical, and even mechanical principles on which the success of his practice depends? What harm will he not do to the cause of religion, whose diction is barbarous and inelegant, whose taste is gross from a want of acquaintance with classick models, who will oppose his own interpretation of a text, or even that of his church, to the facts which the study of the great book of nature is every day bringing to the confirmation and support of revealed religion?</p><p>Franklin College, the fondly cherished Institution, should continue to receive the fostering aid of the Legislature. Notwithstanding the many reverses which have visited the institution, it has now an organization which promises to fulfil most of the purposes of a solid and extensive education. The committee have the most satisfactory assurances, the contributions and appropriations from time to time made by the Legislature, have been faithfully and profitably expended. The College edifice destroyed by fire is nearly rebuilt, a new library and mathematical and philosophical apparatus has been supplied to answer the exigencies of the institution. The committee notice with great gratification the zeal with which the patrons of the College afford a real, as well as an incidental patronage. The most sanguine friends of the College must have anticipated that the embarrassment occasioned by the destruction of one of the college edifices, would

<page id="GA1831.1.P286" no="GA1831.1.287" />

have deterred many young men from matriculating. Yet it is true that no year since the foundation of the institution has there been a greater number of scholars than at present. It is also an additional satisfaction that the committee are assured that with the progressive state of the repairs of the College edifice, all the professorships are now filled with able and efficient professors. The fastidious schoolman will now cease to find cause of derision, and the pride of the Georgian may escape mortification.</p><p>The committee would respectfully ask one other consideration of the Legislature. The subjects which are now, and have hitherto been taught in Franklin College though extensive and solid, are purely elementary. Intelligence cannot be conceived to exist, without the acquisition of a greater part of them. An education afforded by a College or University, should not stop at mere elements. Higher studies should be introduced to occupy the time that [Illegible Text] between youth and manhood, between the years when parental caution would exclude the Pupil from too close a contact with the world, and those in which a professional noviciate can be entered upon with advantage, or the society of men enjoyed. Among such studies stand pre-eminent Grecian Literature and the higher branches of Mathematics. The former opens the door to the most perfect Literature the world has ever known, to the finest models of style, and exquisite instances of taste.The latter are boundless in their applications, and so much a matter of liberal knowledge, that an acquaintance with them may fairly be considered indispensable in every scheme of finished education.</p><p>In adverting to these higher studies, the Committee do not intend to ask at present for the creation of suitable professorships for them. The spirit of improvement which so laudably and enthusiastically actuate the community, will eventually discover their importance, and the single suggestion of their intimate connection with comprehensive intelligence and the philosophy of motion, will insure such an investigation of their usefulness, among the guardians of the literature of the State, as to carry conviction to the mind of every one not predetermined to oppose it, that such professorships are essentially necessary for the more complete organization of the College.</p><p>The Committee beg leave respectfully to suggest the importance of [a] thorough acquaintance of the higher branches of Mathematics to the single subject of Internal Improvement, a subject in which we should all be concerned.

should feel an interest in the investigation of any and every scheme calculated to monopolize any of the advantages resulting from great undertakings, which may tend to defraud us of our just proportions of their advantages. In the application of science to the researches of this character, the advantages ultimately to be derived from machines whether propelled by animal, by steam or any other power, on railways, ordinary roads, canals or other water courses:the subject for investigation, as in all other departments of science, is the accurate ascertainment of the relation which must always exist between an effect, and the cause producing it; in this enquiry must be ascertained the relation existing between the mass to be transported over a certain distance in a given time, and the cause producing that effect. Various circumstances may modify these results, and these circumstances no less than the general principles themselves, can be estimated with any accuracy and precision by mathematical science alone.</p><p>Your Committee are not unapprised of the great value arising from a fixed or permanent system of education in our State, where all orders and ranks of society may be equally entitled to a participation in this blessing.</p><p>It is believed by your Committee, the plan recommended by the board of Trustees is not one well calculated to enlist the good feelings of the people. That it is a plan very invidious in its policy, cannot be denied, and wholly violative of the great principles of equality. Therefore, in every appearance well calculated to sow seeds of strife and contention in every part of our State. It is, nevertheless the fact, the State has heretofore made liberal endowments for the education of indigent youth of our State, by patronizing schools of almost every discription, in every section of the State. It is confidently believed by your Committee that novelty is that kind [of] attraction which too often supersedes merit. And it would be more congenial to the spirit of our institutions to keep down monopolies of every description, by studiously endeavoring to avoid creating undue as well as unnecessary distinctions among our fellow-citizens.</p><p>Your Committee have no hesitancy in believing the plan recommended by the Board of Trustees, is well calculated to impair the confidence of public opinion in our county Academies and schools predicated on the poor school plan. Your Committee furthermore believe that the public funds of the State, which is undeniably the property of all, should not be taken and appropriated exclusively to such an [Illegible Text]

<page id="GA1831.1.P288" no="GA1831.1.289" />

extent, to the benefit of any one institution, located in any section of our community to the disparagement of other institutions equally meritorious. Your Committee have no hesitancy in giving it as their opinion, that well regulated Academies, accompanied with the present advantages of the poor school plan, is one, if persevered in, will redound in incalculable advantages to society at large. Therefore, your Committee most respectfully recommend the following resolutions:</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That the sum recommended to be set apart as an annual permanent endowment for the education of one poor boy from each county in this State, be withheld, and if any further appropriations be necessary to extend the principles of education to the poorer classes of our fellow-citizens, that it be based on the principles of equality, and not those of mere selection or distinction.</p><p>A tabular statement, hereto annexed, will exhibit the amount of dividends yielded by the academic and poor school funds, the proportions in which they have been distributed, the extent to which each county has heen endowed, and the number [of] beneficiaries, so far as could be ascertained by the returns from each county. The view here exhibited, although imperfect, will enable the enquirer to calculate prospectively the reliance which his county has upon the munificence of the State for time to come.</p><p>The Committee are persuaded that no difference of opinion can exist as to the importance of the primary schools in the State, and a strict accountability in the disbursement of the poor school fund. A uniform method of conducting, managing and instructing, cannot fail to give increased usefulness and permanency to the primary schools, and insure that accountability which they consider vitally important to sustain and extend the munificent intentions of the Legislature.</p><p>They recommend the adoption of the resolutions hereto annexed.</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That his Excellency the Governor, be, and he is hereby authorized to appoint three suitable persons to form a system of academic and poor [free] school instruction as nearly uniform as practicable throughout the State,  report to the next meeting of the Legislature, for their adoption or rejection, as to them may seem proper.</p><p><i>Resolved,</i> That his Excellency the Governor, be, and he is hereby authorised to appoint a suitable person to complete [compile,]  have published in pamphlet form all the laws and resolutions now in force in this State, on the subject of public education  free schools, the number of pamphlets to be sufficient

<page id="GA1831.1.P289" no="GA1831.1.290" />

to furnish each member of the present Legislature one, one for the Inferior Court, and one for each Justice of the Peace in each county.</p><p>The reference from the Representative branch of the Legislature, requesting an enquiry into the expediency of establishing a State Library at the seat of Government, has been under the consideration of the Committee. The convenience, benefit and usefulness of an extensive and well selected library at the seat of Government, seem too obvious to admit of doubt. The want of one, is a reproach which should no longer exist. Profitable, useful and efficient legislation can only obtain where the law makers are intimately acquainted with the operation of the laws, and the objects to be attained by them. The first is the result of experience, the latter by a careful examination of the enactments of cotemporaries and predecessors, the last can be acquired alone by the legends of memory or the records of history. The morality of men changes as circumstances and occasions vary. Wise and successful legislation must not only be controlled by these circumstances, but also by an intimate acquaintance with all the principles involved in these [their] circumstances. In a government like ours, dependent for its permanency and freedom on the moral sentiment of the governed, it does seem to be a position self-evident, that the Legislators and the Governors should always be in the possession of the means which can carry into operation most beneficially those principles of human action, which foster and protect the common weal. This object can be materially advanced by a well selected library; which would not [only] afford facility and fitness in legislation, and the Executive part of the Government, but likewise a beneficial amusement to the Legislators and other officers of the government. It is believed that Georgia is the only one of the original confederacy, and the only one except three, of the twenty-four States, which does not profit by the benefits and facilities of a State Library, or an institution of equivalent advantages.</p><p>The Committee report a bill to establish a State Library.</p><p>Read and agreed to.</p><p>THOMAS STOCKS, President.</p><p>Attest, I.

It is true, an imperfect history has been published by a Mr. McCall; but from his want of access to the records, respecting our colonial history, and which are only to be found in the Board of Trade in London, his work presents us with few materials for a long period of years anterior to our revolutionary war.</p><p>All of our historical annals of the time, intervening between the first landing of General Oglethorpe, in Georgia, in 1733, and the declaration of Independence, (a space of near half a century,) are yet locked up in the Colonial Offices of London: and unless the Legislature takes some steps to have them transcribed, for the use of the State, these interesting records, may, by fire or mutilation, or by political

revolutions in Europe, be finally lost to the State, and our long colonial history become a blank.</p><p>If the State ever designs that these records should be transcribed, it can never be done on better terms than is proffered by Dr. Jones.</p><p>Other states have discovered the important necessity of a similar course, and during the past year, the Governor of South Carolina directed a Mr. Cruger, (who went to London on private business,) to inspect the various Colonial Offices, and ascertain the amount of records to be transcribed, relative to the colonial history of that state. The information obtained by Mr. Cruger, was forwarded to the Governor, and tansmitted by him to the Legislature, with a recommendation for them to employ an agent to procure copies of the same.</p><p>Some of the New-England states, have supplied the same defect, in their histories, by a similar proceeding.</p><p>Impressed with these views, and with a sense of the importance of the subject, your committee, in conclusion, recommend the adoption of the following resolutions:</p><p><i>Be it resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Assembly met, and it is hereby resolved by the authority of the same,</i> That the sum of fifteen hundred dollars be, and the same is hereby appropriated, to pay the expenses of Dr. Alexander Jones to London, for the purpose of transcribing the records, now in the Board of Trade and other Colonial Offices of that city, which relate to our early Colonial history: <i>Provided,</i> the said Jones first gives security in a bond of an equal amount, to the Governor of this State, for a faithful discharge of his duty, and for the safe return of the money to the Treasury, in the event the records are not procured.</p><p><i>And be it further resolved,</i> That the said Alexander Jones shall be required to keep a correct account of all his expenditures, while engaged in the above mission, and when he returns, he shall present a copy of the Colonial records obtained, with a list of his expenses, during his absence, to a future committee on Finance of the Legislature, who shall estimate the necessary time required to transcribe the records presented, for the use of the State, and only pay for the necessary time employed in doing the same, and travelling to and from London.

claiming a reduction of twenty-five per cent. in their settlement with the Treasury, under the act passed 23d December, 1830, to raise a tax for the support of government, for the political year 1831, have had the same under consideration, and beg leave to make the following report.</p><p>By the tax law of 1817, the several Banks in the State were required annually to pay into the Treasury free from cost or deduction, thirty-one and a quarter cents, on every hundred dollars worth of Bank Stock employed or in circulation. The tax act first above mentioned, reduces the tax to be levied by said act, at and after the rate of twenty-five per cent. [and under this act, the Banks claim a reduction of twenty-five per cent.] in their settlement with the Treasury, and the Treasurer refuses to settle with the Banks and allow them the twenty-five per cent. deduction, because the act of 1817, required the Banks to pay their tax into the Treasury free from cost or deduction.</p><p>It is true that the tax required from Banks was to be paid into the Treasury free from cost, c. and if there was no subsequent act contravening the act of 1817, in that particular, the Banks would be required to settle with that department free from cost to the State. But your Committee considers that the 6th section of the said act of 1830, authorising a reduction of twenty-five per cent. upon all taxes levied, if not directly, it virtually repeals so much of the said act of 1817, as requires the Banks to pay their tax into the Treasury free from cost or deduction, and that all taxes required by the tax law of 1830, are subject to the twenty-five per cent. reduction, as authorised by said act.</p><p><i>Be it therefore resolved,</i> That the Treasurer settle with the Banks, at and after the rate of twenty-five per cent. reduction upon the amount of tax required of them, and that where any Bank has already settled the full amount of the tax with the Treasury, that the Treasurer, be, and he is authorised and required to refund to the said Bank, the amount so overpaid by the said Bank.</p><p>Read and agreed to.</p><p>ASBURY HULL, Speaker.</p><p>Attest, W.

That afterwards the said plantation was levied on by the State, as the property of the said Peter Deveaux, for arrearages due by him as tax collector of Chatham county, and sold on the 2d November, 1813, at which sale the said Robert Mackay, again became the purchaser for the sum of $8,100, for which purchase money, he gave his two bonds to the Governor of the State of [Illegible Text] and a mortgage on the property; one bond for the sum of $4,218 66 cts. payable on 1st January, 1814, and the other bond for the sum of $4,218 68 cts. payable the first January, 1815, which amounts included the principal and the interest on the principal sums, up to the time the said bonds were made payable. That the said Robert Mackay, died suddenly in the year 1816 without will, leaving the petitioner a widow with eight young children, the oldest not exceeding 14 years of age, and with but limited means for the proper maintainance [and support] of such a family. That the purchase was made when property of that description was highthat the petitioner in the year 1828, paid into the hands of the Solicitor General of the Eastern district, the [Illegible Text] of $8,450, being the amount not only of the principal of such purchase money, but the interest thereon included in the said bond, which sum of money, after deducting the Solicitor's fees and other expenses, was paid by him into the Treasury on [Illegible Text] 3d of Nov. 1828, leaving the estate of the said Robert, still liable to the State, not only for the interest at the rate of 8 per cent. on the said purchase money from the time the same [became] payable, but for the interest at like [Illegible Text] on the interest included in the said bonds, and in fact, if the said payment was not passed to the credit of the principal of the said debt, to the interest, on the whole interest, as such payment, if applied according to law, would not have more than extinguished the interest then due.</p>

The State has already received the principal of the purchase money, with one year's interest on the half of such principal, and two years interest on the other half.
