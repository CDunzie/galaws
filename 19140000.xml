<page id="GA1914.1.P260" no="GA1914.1.264" />

numbers to reasonably accommodate the electors casting ballot in said precinct, and said booths, tables or shelves shall be so arranged that electors cannot be observed by each other in marking the ballots to be cast in said primary elections. In all municipal primary elections the same provisions shall be made for the electors casting their ballots, the expense of making such provisions to be borne by the city or municipality holding such primary elections. <i>Provided,</i> That the terms of this Act shall not be applied to cities or municipalities in said county until same have been adopted by the authorities under whose management primary elections are held in said cities or municipalities. All primary elections held in said county shall be held in a room sufficiently large to accommodate the managers and clerks, and such others as may be necessary to assist in conducting a fair and impartial election, and also sufficiently large for the proper arrangement of the booths, tables or shelves elsewhere provided for in this Act. It shall be the duty of whatever authority under which a primary election is to be held in said county to furnish the managers thereof in each voting precinct in which the primary election is to be held a sufficient number of ballots for the electors in said precincts, which ballot shall be entitled the Official Ballot, to be cast in said primary election. Said ballot shall bear a facsimile of the signature of the authority under which said primary election is held, and no other ballot than the official ballot so prescribed shall be allowed cast in said primary election. Said ballot shall contain the names of all candidates to be voted for in said primary election, with instructions where necessary to Vote for one or Vote for two, or whatever number of candidates are to be nominated in said primary. Said official ballots shall be furnished to no one except the managers selected to hold the primary in which they are to be used. Said ballots shall be printed upon white paper of such texture and thickness as to prevent the possibility of any one, under whose vision said ballot may come after it is folded, discovering the names on the back thereof of any candidate for whom an elector may have

<page id="GA1914.1.P261" no="GA1914.1.265" />

voted for or against in said primary election. No candidate or other individual shall be allowed to solicit votes within a distance of twenty-five feet of the entrance to a polling precinct, and only the number of electors shall be admitted to the precinct equal to the number of voting booths, tables or shelves provided in said precinct; and after entering said precinct no voter shall be allowed to enter into conversations with any one, or allowed to discuss any matter whatsoever with any other voter who may occupy the precinct at the same time. Upon entering the precinct electors shall be provided with a copy of the Official Ballot, by the election managers, and the elector shall immediately repair to the booth, table or shelf, and mark his ballot secretly, after which said ballot shall be deposited with the managers of said primary election. In the event a ballot is spoiled in marking, an elector shall be furnished another one upon the surrender of the spoiled ballot in such numbers as may be necessary, not to exceed three. All electors shall be allowed ten minutes each in which to prepare and cast their ballots, provided that no other electors are waiting to enter the precinct, in which case only five minutes shall be allowed. Any elector who is unable, by reason of physical disability, illiteracy, or otherwise, to prepare his own ballot shall have his ballot prepared by one of the election managers, according to his instructions, or may be allowed to be accompanied into the precinct by his son, brother or father, who shall prepare his ballot according to his instructions. The election managers may, if they deem necessary and proper, require of any voter requesting such assistance to take oath as to such disability. Any primary election manager assisting an elector in preparing his ballot shall keep the ballot of such elector in absolute confidence and secrecy. All managers of primary elections in said county, and each of their assistants shall be legally sworn before entering upon the duties of holding such primary elections, to conduct the same according to law, with fairness and impartially to the interest of all candidates, and to preserve inviolate the secrecy of the manner of ballot, or for whom cast, by

No candidate shall be allowed the nomination in any primary election held in said county if it is shown to the authorities under which said primary is held, that such candidate used whiskey, money or other things of value to influence and secure votes, or that he furnished money, whiskey or other things of value to his friends to be used for such purpose, or that he wilfully violated the provisions of this Act. A bailiff shall be employed at each voting precinct, whose duty it shall be to see that the terms of this Act are properly complied with, and said bailiff shall have the same authority as is conferred upon similar officers by the laws of this State. He shall be legally sworn to faithfully and efficiently perform the duties incumbent upon him. No information in regard to the returns of any primary election held in said county, or the ballot cast therein, shall be given out by an election manager, clerk or bailiff until six o'clock p. m. of the day on which said primary election is held. Within seven days after the date of any primary election held in said county any candidate for a nomination in said primary who has been defeated upon the face of the returns may petition the authority under whose jurisdiction said primary was held for an appeal from or review of the action and decision of the judges of nomination in counting the ballots and announcing the result, and for a recanvass and recount of the ballots cast in any or all of the precincts in which said primary election was held. Upon the filing of said petition, as aforesaid, with affidavits made by officers of election, or by watchers or challengers or other persons, setting forth acts of fraud, mistake, error or irregularity in making said count or returns by the judges of said primary election, or setting forth that some of the returns of said election show on their face ambiguity, error or fraud, mistake or miscalculation by the managers or judges of said election, or if no such affidavits are filed with said petition, and the petitioner, in lieu of such affidavits; offers to give and does give bond, in an amount in each instance to be approved by the authority having jurisdiction of

Said review, recount and recanvass shall be conducted with all possible dispatch and in preference to all other business, under such mode of procedure as the authorities hearing such contest shall prescribe, by means of tellers appointed by them on the recommendation of and with equal representation to the opposing candidates. They shall sit for said purpose at some convenient place agreed upon for the purpose every day, including Saturdays, at least from 9 o'clock a. m. to 5 o'clock p. m., with an intermission of one hour for lunch, until said review, recount and recanvass is completed. Said recount shall be had in the presence of the candidates and their representatives, and of the press and general public. Upon the completion of said recount and recanvass the authorities conducting same shall award the costs of the same as follows: If the result in such primary election is changed thereby, or if there is a change thereby of two per cent. of the total votes recounted, the costs shall be awarded against the authorities under whose jurisdiction said primary election was held. But if the result is not changed thereby as much as two per cent. of the total vote cast in the contested precincts, then the costs shall be awarded against the petitioner, and his bond, if given as above provided, shall be liable therefor. Whenever such appeal from the determination and action of the judges of a primary election in said county is held as aforesaid and completed, the said authorities shall correct the returns and certificate of any canvassing board, which may have been made of said primary election, and shall give to the person so found to be nominated as a candidate, or selected to other position in said primary, a new certificate of nomination or other election in conformity with the result of said recount and recanvass, and shall certify the same to the proper authorities, as said candidate's certificate of

But the town shall have the right, after the award is filed, to abandon its purpose to widen, straighten, lay out, open or establish said street, alley, lane, walk or square, in the event the town council should consider the sum found to be due, would in their judgment make said land so sought to be condemned too expensive to said town.
